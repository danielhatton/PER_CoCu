for items of help too numerous to mention,
\item{}Tony Bland, for tuition in the physics of thin magnetic films,
  for supervising this project with a pleasantly light hand on the
  rudder, for arranging funds for equipment, for suggesting the
  eventual possibility of conducting polarized electron measurements
  on semiconductor-ferromagnet systems (chapter \ref{motive},) to some
  resistance from me at the time, for providing a copy of ``Electronic
  Structure Calculations of Low-Dimensional Transition-Metals''
  \cite{Vega:2002:ESC}, and for other items of help too numerous to

    Practice} \cite{Weston:1985:UVP},
\item{}Thanos Mitrelias, for collaboration in the intermediate
  experiments (sections \ref{autumn-2001-experiments},
  \ref{july-2002-experiments},) in the angle-dependence measurements,
  and in associated hardware upgrades, for immense indulgence and
  patience while I took research time to work on a project of my own
  \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, and for other items of help too numerous to
  mention,
\item{}Klaus Peter Kopper, for collaboration in the intermediate
  experiments (sections \ref{autumn-2001-experiments},
  \ref{july-2002-experiments},) in the angle-dependence measurements,
  and in associated hardware upgrades, for immense indulgence and
  patience while I took research time to work on a project of my own
  \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, for arranging the polishing of the copper
  crystal (section \ref{igs},) for undertaking MOKE measurements
  (sections \ref{bleargh}, \ref{july-2002-experiments}) and for other
  items of help too numerous to mention,
\item{}Christian G\"urtler, for tuition in the use of Labview
  software, for the loan of the temporary replacement electron gun
  (chapter \ref{compact},) and for assistance in the installation of
  that electron gun,

I am certain to have forgotten some individuals who deserve an
acknowledgement here; I hope that they will forgive my omission.
