\begin{itemize}
\item{}2020, September 24th: version 26.3 released.  This does not
  differ in any substantive way from version 26.2: all that's changed
  is that URLs have been updated to account for a change in where the
  author stores documents like this, and Gnuplot scripts have been
  edited (without changing their function) to account for
  non-backwards-compatible changes in the syntax of Gnuplot's command
  language.
\item{}2004, November 30th: version 26.2 released.  This differs from the
  post-viva version, which was approved for the Ph.D., only by virtue
  of having this History chapter restored, the copyright terms rendered
  more web-friendly, and an Endorsements chapter mentioning said
  approval added.
\item{}2003, August 25th: version 21.1 released, in transparent copy
  only.  This differs from the version submitted to the University of
  Cambridge, for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, only by virtue of
  having this History chapter added, and the Makefile altered to allow
  the compilation of a usable transparent copy.
\end{itemize}
