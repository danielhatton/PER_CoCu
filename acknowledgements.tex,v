  characteristics of epitaxial $Fe$-$Ag$ and $Co$-$Ag$ granular thin
  films,'' \cite{Thangaraj:1994:GMM}, ``Correlation between dynamic
  magnetic hysteresis loops and nanoscale roughness of ultrathin $Co$
  films'' \cite{Jiang:1996:CDM}, and ``Correlation between crystalline

\end{itemize}

I am certain to have forgotten some individuals who deserve an
acknowledgement here; I hope that they will forgive my omission.
