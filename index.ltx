\chapter{Motivation}

This chapter describes the motivations for undertaking the theoretical
and experimental study, of polarized electron reflection from a
$Co/Cu(001)$ structure, presented in this thesis.  The material in
this chapter will be repeated in section \ref{motive}, and much of it
may seem more lucid there, after an introduction to the theoretical
principles surrounding polarized electron reflection studies; it is
reproduced here because some understanding of the motives for the
study is likely to be helpful in reading that theoretical
introduction.

Colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory had earlier performed a series
of measurements on the system formed by growing a $0.5\ut{ML}$
$Mn/6\ut{ML}$ $Co/Cu(001)$ multi-layer \cite{Choi:1998:FTD,
  Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  Low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) revealed, through the existence of $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$
order spots, a $c(2\times{}2)$ (chessboard-like) superstructure in the
plane of the film.

Three possible explanations were advanced for the $c(2\times{}2)$
superstructure \cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inter-diffusion of copper atoms through the cobalt layer may
  have led to the formation of a $MnCu$ surface alloy
  \cite{Wuttig:1993:MDB, Kraan:1995:GSS}.  However, these experiments
  were performed at room temperature, which is too cold to permit
  significant inter-diffusion through $6ML$ $Co$ \cite{Kief:1993:GST}.
  This suggestion was therefore ruled out.
\item The manganese may have had an internal $c(2\times{}2)$
  anti-ferromagnetic configuration.  However, the measured
  $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ spot intensity was $\sim 10$ times that
  predicted for magnetic diffraction of this type by Tamura et
  al.~\cite{Tamura:1988:DSA}.  This phenomenon is therefore incapable
  of providing a complete explanation of the observed superstructure.
\item An ordered $MnCo$ surface alloy may have been formed.  Given the
  evidence against the other two models, the observed diffraction
  pattern was attributed to $MnCo$ alloy formation.
\end{itemize}

Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements were taken by
colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory as part of the same project
\cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  The $[110]$
direction Kerr signal was seen to increase with the addition of
manganese, in the regime where the alloy exists.  The immediate
reaction to this is that the system's magnetic moment is increasing,
i.e. that the manganese atoms that are being added are
ferro-magnetically aligned, both with each other and with the cobalt.
However, the simultaneous drop in $[100]$ Kerr signal did not paint
the same picture, and it may be that a change in magneto-optical
response, rather than a genuine addition of magnetic moments, is
responsible for the increased $[110]$ signal.  The possibilities are
in particular need of investigation, given that a series
\cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS} of numerical calculations, using different
approximations, have produced widely differing predictions about the
magnetic properties of this system.

The polarization of a reflected electron beam from the sample surface
provides an alternative to MOKE, for measuring the magnetization,
through the difference, for the two electron spins, in density of
states at a particular energy created by the exchange splitting, and
as such provides an experiment which is interesting by virtue of
having an unpredictable result.  The experiments presented in this
thesis, using a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, are intended as an
intermediate stage on the way to similar measurements on
$MnCo/Co/Cu(001)$, although they could equally well lead to similar
measurements on other multi-layer structures of more direct industrial
relevance, such as metal/ferromagnet or semiconductor/ferromagnet spin
valves.  This possibility may help to address the conclusions,
concerning the motivation for experimental research projects, of
statistical research the author has presented elsewhere
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.

In addition, the measurements for $Co/Cu(001)$, in themselves, allow a
trial run of estimating the parameters in the new theory of this
chapter, and comparing a version of that theory, in which no Weiss
field affects the probing electrons, against another version, in which
an adjustable Weiss field affects the probing electrons.  This task is
undertaken in section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.

\part{Theory of Polarized Electron Reflection}
\label{per-theory}
\chapter[Theory]{Review of Published Theories, a New,
  Classical-Field Theory of Electron Waves as a Polarized Radiation
  Probe of Magnetic Surfaces, Comparison of These Theories with
  Published Experimental Data, and Motivation for New Experiments
  Presented Later in This Thesis}
\label{theoretical-context}

Theories of elastic spin-polarized electron scattering from a surface
can be classified by their underlying philosophy, which may be of
either a band-structure calculation or an analytical type, or by their
possession or otherwise of spatial variation of the scatterer, in the
plane of the surface.  This gives a total of four possible types of
theory:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}band-structure theories, with spatial variation of the
  scatterer; Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE} put forward a numerical
  method for undertaking calculations of this type, which would make
  quantitative predictions about the intensities and polarizations of
  reflected and diffracted beams, from a sample of a precisely
  specified atomic-scale structure, which, along with similar methods,
  has been applied to particular samples by a variety of workers
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Lind:1986:ETC,
    Lind:1987:SSA},
\item{}band-structure theories, without spatial variation of the
  scatterer; the method of Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE} can be applied
  in this way, but, as far as the author is aware, has not been,
  perhaps because ignoring the in-plane variation of the scatterer
  eliminates any possibility of examining diffraction orders other
  than the specular reflection,
\item{}analytical theories, with spatial variation of the scatterer;
  Darwin \cite{Darwin:1928:DME} produced a classical-field theory, in
  which an electron wave impinged on a sinusoidal electrostatic
  potential and magnetic flux density, whose lack of a Fourier
  component of zero in-plane wave-vector eliminated any possibility of
  examining the specular reflection, and
\item{}analytical theories, without spatial variation of the
  scatterer; the author produces a theory of this form, later in this
  chapter.  Its lack of any in-plane variation in the scatterer means
  that it is valid only for the specular reflection, not for other
  diffraction orders.
\end{enumerate}

Theories, of course, are refined (in the sense of choosing an atomic
configuration for a band-structure theory, or estimating the
parameters in an analytical theory,) and compared for their
correspondence to reality, by their ability to match experimental
results.  This is primarily an experimental thesis; in part
\ref{main-experiment}, some experimental polarized electron reflection
results, along with the means used to obtain them, are presented, and
in section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}, they are used to estimate
the parameters in the new theory presented in this chapter, and to
compare, for correspondence to reality, two versions of this theory,
in one of which the ferromagnetic samples exert a (statistically
significant) Weiss field on the incident electrons, and in the other
of which, they do not.

The only other theories mentioned above, which can be used to examine
a specular reflection, are that of Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE}, and
its close relatives, and some attention should be given to the match
between these theories and the experimental results of part
\ref{main-experiment}, and indeed the new theory of this chapter.  The
author has been unable to find an application of these theories to
specular reflection from a copper or cobalt surface, which would allow
direct, quantitative comparison with the experimental results,
although one might expect, in some rather ill-defined sense,
qualitative features in the specular reflections from other materials
to carry over to copper and cobalt.  This does not, however, prevent
direct comparison of Feder-type theories with the new theory presented
in this chapter, because the latter is not designed to be chemically
specific.

An important link between the band-structure theories and the new
theory presented in this chapter is that, in explaining the basis of
the numerical band-structure calculation, Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE}
appears to look forward to the day when the atomic-scale structure,
which is fed to the numerical method, can instead be encoded in the
continuous, adjustable parameters of an analytical theory, and
suggests electrostatic potential and magnetic flux density as
parameters for use in this fashion.  Where, in a theory based on these
parameters, the scatterer has mirror symmetry about the scattering
plane, as does the scatterer assumed in the new theory of this
chapter, this symmetry can \cite{Feder:1985:PTE} be combined with
time-reversal symmetry, to show that the reflected beam polarization,
for an unpolarized incident beam, is parallel to the magnetic flux
density, when the latter is either in the scattering plane, or
perpendicular to the scattering plane.  This provides two important
tests of the plausibility of any proposed emergent-phenomena theory;
the new theory presented in this chapter passes both tests.

Another such link is that a band-structure calculation has been
reviewed (figure \ref{copied-theory-figure}) \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP},
which appears to agree, to approximately the same standard of
precision that is possessed by relevant measurements, to be reviewed
in section \ref{experimental-context}, with the new theory presented
in this chapter, that at incident electron energies greater than
$\sim{}60\ut{eV}$, where the Taylor expansion allows the latter to
make quantitative predictions, the reflected beam polarization from a
nickel $(001)$ surface is independent of incident electron energy and
of angle of incidence.  Several other band-structure theories for
$Ni(001)$, with different atomic structures, have been reviewed
\cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP}, which have a lesser similarity to the new
theory of this chapter, and a correspondingly less good fit to
experimental data to be reviewed in section \ref{experimental-context}
\cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP}.

\label{copied-theory-figure}
\end{figure}

Striking differences between band-structure theories and the new
theory of this chapter are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}A band-structure theory has been reviewed
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} that predicts significant polarization (at
  some angles of incidence, more than $0.4$) of an $82\ut{eV}$
  electron beam, by reflection from a tungsten $(001)$ surface.  Since
  tungsten is not ferro-magnetic, the new theory of this chapter,
  because it ignores spin-orbit effects, predicts no polarization, yet
  it claims that $82\ut{eV}$ is within the region, of energies much
  less than the electron rest mass energy, where it is reasonable to
  ignore spin-orbit effects.  However, experiments to be reviewed in
  section \ref{experimental-context} suggest a way for both theories
  to survive this apparent contradiction between them, which will be
  discussed there.
\item{}The same band-structure calculation for tungsten predicts
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} a polarization, which changes its sign
  several times, as the angle of incidence $I$ is varied from $0$ to
  $30\ut{^{\circ}}$.  The new theory of this chapter predicts a
  polarization independent of $I$.
\item{}A band-structure calculation has been reviewed
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} that predicts significant polarization (up
  to $0.8$) of the reflected beam from tungsten $(001)$ in a few
  narrow ($\sim{}20\ut{eV}$) energy bands, while the new theory of
  this chapter predicts no polarization; however, the band-structure
  calculation does predict near-zero polarizations outside these
  bands.
\item{}A band-structure theory has been reviewed
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} that predicts significant polarization (at
  some scattering plane orientations, more than $0.8$) of an
  $60\ut{eV}$ electron beam, by reflection from a platinum $(111)$
  surface.  Since platinum is not ferro-magnetic, the new theory of
  this chapter, because it ignores spin-orbit effects, predicts no
  polarization, yet it claims that $60\ut{eV}$ is within the region,
  of energies much less than the electron rest mass energy, where it
  is reasonable to ignore spin-orbit effects.  However, experiments to
  be reviewed in section \ref{experimental-context} suggest a way for
  both theories to survive this apparent contradiction between them,
  which will be discussed there.
\item{}A band-structure theory has been reviewed
  \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP} that predicts a reflected polarization from
  an iron $(110)$ surface, which oscillates as the incident electron
  energy is varied, with an amplitude of $\sim{}0.1$.  This is rather
  different from the constant, possibly non-zero polarization
  predicted for this ferro-magnetic material by the new theory of this
  chapter.
\end{itemize}

\section[New Theory Introduction]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of
  Polarized Electron Reflection: Introduction}
\label{intro}

Having reviewed a number of published theoretical perspectives on
polarized electron reflection, and compared them against a promised,
new theory, it is now time to present that theory.

\subsection{Polarized Neutron Reflection}

Polarized neutron reflection, or PNR, is \cite{Blundell:1992:PNR,
  Blundell:1993:PNR} an established experimental technique for the
measurement of layer-dependent magnetization vector in magnetic
multi-layers.  A multi-layer structure is \cite{Blundell:1992:PNR,
  Blundell:1993:PNR} modelled as a series of steps in nuclear
potential and magnetic flux density.  The amplitude reflection
coefficient for neutron waves at each step is then calculated by
applying the usual \cite{Rae:1992:QM} boundary conditions to the
spin-up and spin-down wave-functions at the step, given the change in
wave-vector produced by the potential step.  The change in wave-vector
depends on the neutron's spin direction because of the torque exerted
upon the neutron magnetic moment, by the magnetic field.  Therefore,
the spin polarization of the reflected neutron beam, as a function of
incident beam energy, provides an indicator of the depth-resolved
magnetization profile of the sample.

\subsection{Polarized Electron Reflection}

Polarized electron reflection and diffraction are \cite{Lind:1986:ETC,
  Lind:1987:SSA} also established experimental techniques, for the
characterization of magnetic surfaces.  The measurement is identical
to PNR except for the substitution of electrons for neutrons, and the
unavailability \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} of the
Stern-Gerlach experiment, either for controlling the incident
polarization, or for measuring the reflected polarization.  The
Stern-Gerlach experiment is \cite{Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSA}
typically replaced by a Mott polarimeter \cite{Hodge:1979:MES,
  Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}, for measuring the reflected
polarization.  Electrons have significant advantages over neutrons for
this purpose: an electron beam can be produced using a device roughly
equivalent to a light-bulb filament, whereas a neutron beam is
typically produced using a nuclear reactor.  Also, the magnetic moment
of the electron is nearly two thousand times that of the neutron.

Despite the long-standing use of polarized electron reflection as an
experimental technique, as far as I'm aware, there has been no
attempt to develop a theoretical model of the process, along the lines
of that used for PNR, in order to interpret the results in terms of
the depth profile of the magnetization in the sample.  My intention
here is to produce an analysis of polarized electron reflection
similar to that of PNR by Blundell and Bland \cite{Blundell:1992:PNR,
  Blundell:1993:PNR}.  Section \ref{per-supplement} includes more
details of the derivations of equations, which are only sketched here.

  Polarized Electron Reflection: Amplitude Reflection Coefficient for
  an Electron Pure State, at a Single Step in Electric Potential and
  Magnetic Flux Density}

\caption{Reflection of an Electron Wave by a Single Step in Electric
Potential and Magnetic Flux Density}
\label{single_step}
\end{figure}
The first step in the analysis of reflection is to build a
potential-theory model of the sample, as a series of steps in electric
potential and magnetic flux density (figures \ref{dhatton1},
\ref{single_step}.)  The existence of sudden steps in magnetic flux
density follows \cite{Hammond:1997:EEI} from Maxwell's equations, for
an in-plane magnetization.  Shape anisotropy encourages
\cite{Johnson:1996:MAM, Hope:1997:SPR} the magnetizations of film
structures to be in-plane, and experiments confirm
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Krams:1992:MAU, Heinrich:1993:UMM,
Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} that the permanent magnetization in
$Co/Cu(001)$ is in-plane.  The existence of sudden steps in
electrostatic potential is supported by a comment in \emph{Calculated
Electronic Properties of Metals} \cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP}, although
this book is concerned primarily with bulk materials, and there is the
possibility that steps, which are sudden on the scale of bulk
materials, may be gradual on the scale of electron de Broglie
wavelengths.  I suspect that such a possibility would be easily
detectable in the experiments, because there would be no reflection
without a sudden potential step.

In reality, I expect the ``magnetic flux density'' part of the
potential not to be a genuine magnetic flux density, but a Weiss
field; in this paragraph, I will explain what the Weiss field is, and
why I expect it, rather than a genuine magnetic flux density, to
determine the behaviour of the electron beam.  The Weiss field is a
quantum-mechanical effect related to symmetry requirements on the
joint wave-function of a pair of electrons.  To illustrate the effect,
following loosely arguments in \emph{Solid State Physics}
\cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} and \emph{Quantum Physics}
\cite{Gasiorowicz:1996:QP}, consider two electrons, labelled $i = 1$
and $i = 2$, occupying two spatial states $|\psi_i>$ and $|\phi_i>$,
which are similar, atomic-orbital-like states, centred on two
neighbouring atomic sites, in a solid, and which also have possible
spin states $|\uparrow_i>$ and $|\downarrow_i>$.  It is a requirement
of quantum mechanics that the two electrons are indistinguishable from
one another; therefore, their joint spatial state cannot be a simple
state such as $|\psi_1>|\phi_2>$, which would identify a particular
electron as being on each atomic site.  To fulfil the
indistinguishableness requirement, the state must be such that the
only effect of exchanging the particle labels is to introduce a
uniform phase shift in the wave-function, i.e.~the joint spatial state
must be
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1>|\phi_2>+\exp{}(i\theta_A)|\psi_2>|\phi_1>)$,
where $\theta_A$ is the uniform phase shift in question.  Similarly,
indistinguishableness limits the joint spin states to
$|\uparrow_1>|\uparrow_2>$, $|\downarrow_1>|\downarrow_2>$, or
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow_1>|\downarrow_2>+\exp{}(i\theta_B)|\uparrow_2>|\downarrow_1>)$,
where $\theta_B$ is the uniform phase shift involved in particle
exchange due to the spin part of the wave-function alone.  Given that
electrons are fermions, quantum mechanics, further, demands that the
total phase shift on particle exchange, $\theta_A+\theta_B$, or simply
$\theta_A$, where no $\theta_B$ is involved in the spin wave-function,
is $\pi$.  One can identify the concept of the two electrons' spins
being parallel with the spin states where no $\theta_B$ is involved,
or where $\theta_B = 0$; therefore, when the electrons' spins are
parallel, $\theta_A = \pi$, and the joint spatial state is
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1>|\phi_2>-|\psi_2>|\phi_1>)$; this is an
odd function of the spatial displacement between the two electrons,
and must, therefore, vanish when this displacement is zero,
prohibiting the two electrons from being spatially coincident and,
providing that the wave-function varies smoothly with this
displacement, rendering the probability of them being very close
together low.  Given that there is an electrostatic repulsion between
the electrons, this is a low-energy state.  Similarly, one can
identify the concept of the two electrons' spins being anti-parallel
with the $\theta_B = \pi$ spin state, giving a joint spatial state
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1>|\phi_2>+|\psi_2>|\phi_1>)$; this even
function of the displacement between the two electrons does not
prevent the electrons from being very close together, or even
spatially coincident; their electrostatic repulsion, therefore,
renders it a high-energy state.  To summarize, the state in which the
electrons' spins are anti-parallel has a higher energy, by some amount
$\Delta{}V$, than the state in which their spins are parallel; it is
as if each electron's spin generates a magnetic flux density $B =
\frac{m_e\Delta{}V}{e\hbar}$, acting on the spin magnetic moment of
the other electron.  The Weiss field is this effective magnetic flux
density, produced by quantum-mechanical symmetry considerations,
scaled up to a situation where an electron interacts not just with one
other electron, but with the whole population of other electrons in a
solid.  I expect the Weiss field, not the genuine magnetic flux
density, to be the effect detected with the reflected electron beam,
because the Weiss field in transition metals is
\cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} roughly a factor of $100$ larger than the
genuine magnetic flux density in the remnant state; however, some
caution about this expectation is in order, because, as is clear from
the argument above, the spatial states of the electrons are crucial in
producing the Weiss field, and the spatial states of the unbound
electrons being reflected are very similar neither to the single-site
atomic orbitals described above, nor to the states of the transition
metals' $3d$ electrons, for which the factor of $100$ is known to hold
good.

It will be noted that, in the model, both the electrostatic potential
and the Weiss field are taken to be laterally homogeneous, i.e.~not to
vary with position in the plane of the film; this gives the appearance
of being a rather strong assumption about the configuration of the
magnetic film structure being studied.  In particular, it gives the
appearance of an implicit assumption of single-domain magnetization;
this is an assumption that has been made in other workers'
\cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF, Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP,
Bland:1998:ASE} explanations of the behaviour of $Co/Cu(001)$ film
structures, and which has \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} some justification
from Brillouin light scattering experiments; it is (section
\ref{bleargh}) also supported by magneto-optical Kerr effect
measurements.  In reality, the use of laterally homogeneous models
does not imply any assumption about the configuration of the film
structure or its domain structure; this study is concerned with the
specular reflection, which is the scattered beam, the in-plane
component of whose wave-vector is the same as the in-plane component
of wave-vector of the incident beam.  In the general theory of
scattering of matter waves by a potential, a scattered beam whose
in-plane wave-vector component differs from that of the incident beam
by $\vc{k}$ results from the Fourier component of the scattering
potential with in-plane wave-vector $\vc{k}$: specifically, the
specularly reflected beam results from the average value of the
potential, over the area of the sample covered by the incident beam,
and is unaffected by variations in the scattering potential, such as
domain structure, which are encoded in the Fourier components of the
scattering potential with non-zero in-plane wave vectors, the effects
of which appear only in the diffraction orders.  Of course, if there
are domains of varying magnetization directions, within the region
illuminated by the incident beam, then the average Weiss field
detected by polarized electron reflection will be smaller than the
saturation Weiss field within a single domain, but the situation is
still within the capability of this theory to handle.

Next, I need to discover the amplitude reflection coefficient, for a
pure, coherent, electron wave, at a single step (figure
\ref{single_step}.)  The incident and transmitted electron waves are
modelled as plane waves, with well-defined wave-vector components $p$
in the plane of the interface, and $q_i$ perpendicular to the
interface.  $p$ must be the same for all the waves, in order to
satisfy the boundary condition of continuity of the wave-function at
the interface.  Strictly, the eigen-states of a Hamiltonian which
includes a magnetic field are not plane waves; more about this later
(section \ref{incomplete}.)  The amplitude reflection coefficient is
\cite{Rae:1992:QM} this:
\begin{equation}
r_{01} = \frac{q_0-q_1}{q_0+q_1}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
or, for a general interface, this one:
\begin{equation}
r_{ij} = \frac{q_i-q_j}{q_i+q_j}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Next, I need to build an expression for the energy of the electrons.
There will be kinetic energy terms, along with an electrostatic
potential energy, and a term due to the torque, on the electron
magnetic moment, in a magnetic field \cite{Rae:1992:QM}. The form used
for this last term assumes a well-defined energy for all directions of
the electron spin.  Strictly, only certain spin directions are
eigen-states of a Hamiltonian that includes a magnetic field; more
about this later (section \ref{incomplete}.)  This leads to this
expression
\begin{equation}
q_i =
\left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}(1+x_i)^{1/2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for the perpendicular wave-vector component, where $I$ represents an
angle of incidence, and the potential energy terms are represented by
these dimensionless numbers:
\begin{equation}
\label{define-x}
x_i = y_i+z_i\cos{}S_i\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{define-y}
y_i = \frac{eV_i}{E\cos^2I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{define-z}
z_i = -\frac{e\hbar{}B_i}{2m_eE\cos^2I}\pnc{;}
\end{equation}
$S_i$ is the angle between the electron spin direction and the
magnetic flux density in region $i$, and $E_b$ is the total energy of
the incident electrons, and therefore, by conservation of energy, of
all the electrons.

I now use a binomial expansion \cite{Gallagher::MFH} for the case
where the potential energy terms are much smaller than the total
electron energy, where the dimensionless numbers I've just devised
are small.  The magnetic term associated with the Weiss field in a
ferromagnet is \cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP} a few tenths of an
electron-volt, and the electrostatic contact potentials in the metals
which I study will \cite{:2001:KPF, :2001:PTE} not be more than a few
volts, whereas, in my experimental set-up, the incident electron
energies range from a few hundred to a few thousand electron volts, so
this approximation seems reasonable.  With this expansion, the
amplitude reflection coefficient is this:
\begin{equation}
r_{ij} = \frac{1}{4}x_i-\frac{1}{4}x_j-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2-\frac{1}{8}x_ix_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

  from the Surface of a Bulk Magnetic Sample}
\label{bulk}

An unpolarized incident electron beam is \cite{Kessler:1976:PE,
  Kessler:1985:PE} an incoherent superposition of pure states
  representing all directions of the incident spin.  The polarization
  of the reflected beam from any surface is, therefore, given by an
  average of the polarization over all polarization directions,
  weighted according to the intensity reflection coefficient for each
  polarization.  This incoherent averaging process (section
  \ref{bulk-details}) gives this reflected polarization from a bulk
  surface (figure \ref{dhatton1})
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{polarization}
P & = & \frac{2y_1z_1}{3y_1^2+z_1^2}+O(\{y_1,z_1\})\br
& = &
-\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}+O(\{y_1,z_1\})\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}
Both the term given explicitly, and the next term in the binomial
expansion, are in the direction of the magnetic flux density in the
bulk material.  The polarization, predicted by this equation, is shown
as a function of Weiss field $B$, for a fixed electrostatic potential
$V= -0.9\ut{V}$, in figure \ref{display-cft-predictions}.

\caption{Predicted Reflected Beam Polarization against the Ratio of
  Weiss Field to Electric Potential, in the Sample}
\label{display-cft-predictions}
\end{figure}

The most salient qualitative feature of this polarization formula is
that, at high incident electron energies, the reflected polarization
is dominated by a non-zero term, which is independent of the incident
electron energy, and controlled by the balance between the
electrostatic potential and the magnetic flux density, in the sample.
This polarization can be as large as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ in either
direction.

  Reflection: Multi-Layer Structures}

\caption{Reflection Paths for an Electron Wave in a Single Magnetic Layer}
\label{single-layer}
\end{figure}
I propose the extension of this analysis to magnetic multi-layer
structures, by using the theory of Fabry-Perot etalons, as is
\cite{Blundell:1992:PNR, Blundell:1993:PNR} already the practice in
PNR.  There are infinitely many possible paths for reflection from a
multi-layer structure, indexed by how many times the electron wave
``bounces'' within each layer.  In the diagram (figure
\ref{single-layer},) we can see paths with no bounces, with one
bounce, and with two bounces.  For a given, pure incident wave, the
reflected waves from the various paths are superposed coherently to
build the reflected wave, each term in the coherent superposition
including an amplitude factor due to the amplitude reflection or
transmission coefficient at each interface which it has encountered,
and a phase factor due to the path length which it has traversed in
the magnetic layers.  This will result in a spin-dependent amplitude
reflection coefficient for the whole multi-layer system, which will
provide the weightings to go into the incoherent superposition over an
unpolarized incident beam.  This incoherent superposition, as for the
bulk sample, will give the reflected polarization.  I expect working
through the maths for this to be trivial, but time-consuming.

\section[Comments]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of Polarized Electron
  Reflection: Comments on This Analysis}
\label{incomplete}

There follow comments on some assumptions in this analysis.  Firstly,
there is the matter of modelling the electrons as a plane wave.  This
is equivalent to neglecting the deflection of the electrons by the
Lorentz force, which means taking the limit of weak magnetic fields;
this limit has, in any case, been taken in the binomial expansion.
The same convention, of neglecting this deflection, was adopted by
Weber et al.  \cite{Weber:1999:EAF}, when they analysed the spin
polarization of transmitted electron waves.

Secondly, there is the issue of assuming that all electron spin
directions are eigen-states of the Hamiltonian.  In this, I depart
from the tradition of analysis of PNR, where matrices are
\cite{Blundell:1992:PNR, Blundell:1993:PNR} used to represent the
Zeeman energy, and the reflection coefficient, without any need for
this approximation.  I also depart from the work of Weber et al.
\cite{Weber:1999:EAF} on electron transmission: they regard the Larmor
precession, which is a manifestation of the fact that not all spin
directions are eigen-states of the Hamiltonian in a magnetic field, as
crucial in determining the transmitted polarization.  I propose the
production of a more ``first-principles'' model, which will use the
matrix representation of the reflection coefficients, and therefore
capture the Larmor precession, and other spin-flip scattering effects.
However, this model is not proposed as a replacement for the one
presented here, but as a complement to it.  What I suggest is to
subject both models, along with a third, completely classical,
reflection model (section \ref{fully-classical},) to experimental
data, and use the well-established \cite{MacKay:1992:BMA} methods of
Bayesian statistics, first to infer the parameters of magnetic flux
density, electric potential, and layer thickness, for each model, then
to judge the relative confidence that can be placed in each model.

One reason for not simply abandoning all but the most
``first-principles'' of the models is given by Anderson
\cite{Anderson:1972:MID}, who points out that any system, more
complicated than a molecule of approximately four atoms, is almost
never in an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, with the result that the
Schr\"odinger equation does not describe the state of the system.
This is because the tunnelling-like processes, which would otherwise
collapse the system into an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, are very
slow for complicated systems: often very slow compared with the age of
the universe, and certainly very slow compared with the rate of
occurrence of measurement-like interactions with the outside world,
which collapse the system into eigen-states of operators other than
the Hamiltonian.  Therefore, it can't be guaranteed that the model
that implements a Schr\"odinger equation with the most realistic
Hamiltonian will always be the most useful, in describing the real
behaviour of the system.

In addition, I have devised a very different argument
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} for not always preferring the most
first-principles model.

Thirdly, it is worthwhile to comment on the effect on the polarization
of transmitted waves, due to spin-dependent loss of electrons to
inelastic processes, which was noted by Weber et al.
\cite{Weber:1999:EAF}.  At first glance, the classical-field analysis
above appears to be entirely elastic.  However, it is capable of
assimilating the effect of these processes, which would appear as
imaginary parts in the electric potential and magnetic flux density.

\section[Conclusions]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of Polarized Electron
  Reflection: Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item The spin polarization of the reflected electron beam from a bulk
  magnetic surface, in the model described, is this:
\begin{equation}
\vc{P} = -\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1\vc{B_1}}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}+O(\{y_1,z_1\})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
\item{}The rate of electrons leaving the sample, in the reflected beam
(figure \ref{sd},) is, from integration of equation
\ref{reflected-amplitude},
\begin{equation}
\label{reflected-intensity}
G =
\left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{F}{e}$ is the rate of electrons arriving at the sample,
in the incident beam.
\item The extension of the model to multi-layer systems is likely to
  be a trivial, but time-consuming, mathematical task.
\item Two other, similar models are suggested, one of which differs
  from this by the use of a more ``first-principles'' treatment of the
  Zeeman energy, and the other, discussed in section
  \ref{fully-classical}, by a fully classical treatment of the
  reflection process, and
\item there is a strong case for retaining all three models, and using
  Bayesian statistics to compare them in the light of experimental
  data, rather than discarding all but the most ``first-principles''
  model.
\end{itemize}

Other workers have obtained theoretical predictions for reflected
electron beam polarizations, from magnetic and non-magnetic surfaces.
In chapter \ref{theoretical-context}, several of these were discussed,
and compared and contrasted with the theory of this chapter.

Before moving on to a completely classical version of this theory, an
aside is in order, on the angle-dependence of the intensity $G$ in
this theory, which has a fascinating $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$ form, in
terms of the angle of incidence $I$.  I have access to measurements,
of the currents\footnote{Strictly, being composed of electrons, these
currents are negative, but they are here presented as positive, for
greater ease of discussion; all the theoretical analysis has a sign
convention to match this.} $H_1$ and $H_2$ arriving at the Mott
polarimeter's two channeltrons after reflection, as a function of the
angle $\theta$, by which the sample is rotated about the scattering
plane normal, starting from an arbitrary (but permanently marked)
origin, made in conjunction with colleagues at the Cavendish
Laboratory, which I supposed may help to demonstrate this form.  The
incident electron beam energy and current, the potentials at the
polarimeter electrodes, and the translational position of the sample
were held constant throughout.

The original purpose of making these measurements was to find the
$\theta$ value, equivalent to $I = \frac{\pi}{4}$, for which the
centre of the reflected beam struck the centre of the polarimeter's
entrance hole.  This value of $\theta$ was expected to maximize $H_1$
and $H_2$.  The details of the functional forms of $H_1$ and $H_2$
away from this maximum are unknown, but a sensible guess is a
Gaussian,
\begin{equation}
H_i = H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{M^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right)+D_i\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
of which $H_i^{(0)}$, $\sigma_i$ and $D_i$ are adjustable parameters
representing the height and width of the maximum, and any additive
systematic error in the ammeter, respectively.  $M$ is the distance,
measured perpendicular to the ray direction of the reflected beam, by
which the centre of the reflected beam misses the centre of the
polarimeter's entrance hole.  $M \propto{}
\tan{}\left(I-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$, so
\begin{eqnarray}
H_i & = &
H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{tan^2\left(I-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2w_i^2}\right)+D_i\br
& = &
H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{tan^2\left(\theta_i^{(0)}-\theta-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2w_i^2}\right)+D_i\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
where $w_i$ is a re-scaled version of the width parameter $\sigma_i$,
$\theta_i^{(0)}$ is another adjustable parameter, representing the
arbitrary origin of the angle measurements, and the sign convention is
representative of the fact that the angles are measured in such a way
that increasing $\theta$ reduces $I$.  This is how one might expect
the system to behave, if the reflection coefficient is independent of
the angle of incidence.

If, on the other hand, the reflection coefficient depends on the angle
of incidence, in the way predicted by the theory presented above, one
obtains
\begin{equation}
H_i =
\frac{H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{tan^2\left(\theta_i^{(0)}-\theta-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2w_i^2}\right)}{\cos^4(\theta_i^{(0)}-\theta)}+D_i\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
In figures \ref{angular-1} and \ref{angular-2}, the experimental data
are presented, along with best-fit versions, obtained by a
least-squares method, of both theories.
\begin{figure}

\caption{Current Arriving at Channeltron 1, against Rotation Angle of
  Sample; Points with Error Bars Show Experimental Results, and Lines

  $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$.}

  One with a Reflection Coefficient Proportional to
  $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$.}
\label{angular-2}
\end{figure}

The predictions of the two models are almost indistinguishable from
one another, and both are, therefore, about equally good fits to the
experimental data.  This is because the function $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$
is characterized by sharp singularities at the most extreme possible
angles of incidence, the grazing incidence angles $I = -\frac{\pi}{2}$
and $I = \frac{\pi}{2}$, with a broad, flat intervening region.
Within this flat region where the experiments were undertaken, the
classical-field theory's reflection coefficient is, to a very good
approximation, independent of angle of incidence; therefore, it is
unsurprising that the predictions are indistinguishable from those of
a model with a reflection coefficient exactly independent of angle of
incidence.  There would be little point in attempting to extend the
experiment into the grazing angles of incidence, because, in this
region, the component of the electron motion perpendicular to the
sample surface is tiny, nullifying the classical-field theory's
fundamental assumption that the kinetic energy associated with this
component of the electron motion is much larger than the potential
energy step at the surface.  This also absolves us of the need to
worry about the ``un-physical'' singularities; they are, in any case,
outside the domain of validity of the theory.

The aside over, it is time to turn to a fully classical theory of
polarized electron reflection.

\section[Classical Theory]{A Completely Classical Polarized Electron
  Reflection Theory}
\label{fully-classical}

Above, (section \ref{conclusions},) I suggested that it might be
enlightening to develop a completely classical theory of polarized
electron reflection; this will be done in this section.  The classical
condition for reflection from a bulk sample is rather simple.  In
terms of the dimensionless numbers defined in equations
\ref{define-x}, \ref{define-y}, and \ref{define-z}, an electron is
reflected if
\begin{equation}
x_1 \geq{} 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and is not reflected if
\begin{equation}
x_1 < 1\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

This thesis is (section \ref{arc}) concerned with circumstances where
$|x_1| \ll{} 1$.  In this case, classical theory predicts a zero
intensity reflection coefficient.  Therefore, the measured reflections
presented in chapter \ref{results}, and those reviewed in section
\ref{experimental-context}, are purely quantum effects.

This does not imply that the classical theory is of no interest; an
important test of the plausibility of the quantum theory presented
earlier in this chapter is its obedience to Ehrenfest's theorem, which
states \cite{Gasiorowicz:1996:QP} that, when the wave-function varies
in space much more rapidly than the potential, the predictions of
classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are the same.

In this case, the potential includes a step.  Therefore, the
wave-function varies in space much more rapidly than the potential
only as the energy of the incident electrons tends to infinity.  In
this case, both classical theory, and the quantum theory presented
earlier in this chapter, predict a zero reflection coefficient, and
Ehrenfest's theorem is obeyed.

\section{Motivation for Experiments}
\label{motive}

Above, some theoretical perspectives have been presented, on polarized
electron reflection measurements of magnetic materials.  This section
details the motivation for undertaking the polarized electron
reflection measurements on a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, described in part
\ref{main-experiment}.

Colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory had earlier performed a series
of measurements on the system formed by growing a $0.5\ut{ML}$
$Mn/6\ut{ML}$ $Co/Cu(001)$ multi-layer \cite{Choi:1998:FTD,
  Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  Low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) revealed, through the existence of $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$
order spots, a $c(2\times{}2)$ (chessboard-like) superstructure in the
plane of the film.

Three possible explanations were advanced for the $c(2\times{}2)$
superstructure \cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inter-diffusion of copper atoms through the cobalt layer may
  have led to the formation of a $MnCu$ surface alloy
  \cite{Wuttig:1993:MDB, Kraan:1995:GSS}.  However, these experiments
  were performed at room temperature, which is too cold to permit
  significant inter-diffusion through $6ML$ $Co$ \cite{Kief:1993:GST}.
  This suggestion was therefore ruled out.
\item The manganese may have had an internal $c(2\times{}2)$
  anti-ferromagnetic configuration.  However, the measured
  $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ spot intensity was $\sim 10$ times that
  predicted for magnetic diffraction of this type by Tamura et
  al.~\cite{Tamura:1988:DSA}.  This phenomenon is therefore incapable
  of providing a complete explanation of the observed superstructure.
\item An ordered $MnCo$ surface alloy may have been formed.  Given the
  evidence against the other two models, the observed diffraction
  pattern was attributed to $MnCo$ alloy formation.
\end{itemize}

Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements were taken by
colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory as part of the same project
\cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  The $[110]$
direction Kerr signal was seen to increase with the addition of
manganese, in the regime where the alloy exists.  The immediate
reaction to this is that the system's magnetic moment is increasing,
i.e. that the manganese atoms that are being added are
ferro-magnetically aligned, both with each other and with the cobalt.
However, the simultaneous drop in $[100]$ Kerr signal did not paint
the same picture, and it may be that a change in magneto-optical
response, rather than a genuine addition of magnetic moments, is
responsible for the increased $[110]$ signal.  The possibilities are
in particular need of investigation, given that a series
\cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS} of numerical calculations, using different
approximations, have produced widely differing predictions about the
magnetic properties of this system.

The polarization of a reflected electron beam from the sample surface
provides an alternative to MOKE, for measuring the magnetization,
through the difference, for the two electron spins, in density of
states at a particular energy created by the exchange splitting, and
as such provides an experiment which is interesting by virtue of
having an unpredictable result.  The experiments presented in this
thesis, using a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, are intended as an
intermediate stage on the way to similar measurements on
$MnCo/Co/Cu(001)$, although they could equally well lead to similar
measurements on other multi-layer structures of more direct industrial
relevance, such as metal/ferromagnet or semiconductor/ferromagnet spin
valves.  This possibility may help to address the conclusions,
concerning the motivation for experimental research projects, of
statistical research the author has presented elsewhere
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.

In addition, the measurements for $Co/Cu(001)$, in themselves, allow a
trial run of estimating the parameters in the new theory of this
chapter, and comparing a version of that theory, in which no Weiss
field affects the probing electrons, against another version, in which
an adjustable Weiss field affects the probing electrons.  This task is
undertaken in section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.

$Co/Cu(001)$ is a much-studied system.  Before discussing previously
published experimental polarized electron reflection results, and
presenting the new, polarized electron reflection experiment, which is
at the heart of this thesis, it will be as well to review other
workers' published results on the structure and magnetic properties of
this system.

\section[Literature Review]{Review of Published Information on the
  Structure and Magnetic Properties of $Co/Cu(001)$}
\label{bleargh}

Although bulk cobalt is \cite{Taylor:1963:CDM} a hexagonal close
packed metal at room temperature and pressure, thin cobalt films,
grown by molecular beam epitaxy on $Cu(001)$, adopt
\cite{Smardz:1990:RTF, Schmid:1993:FIT, Ramsperger:1996:GSF} the
face-centred cubic structure of the copper; this epitaxial structure
requires \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} some elastic strain in the cobalt, and
breaks down \cite{Weber:1996:SRM, Bland:1998:ASE} for large
thicknesses\footnote{In this section, the common convention of giving
thicknesses in mono-layers is followed, whereas elsewhere in this
thesis, thicknesses are given in units related to the metre.  From
comments in ``Magnetic Anisotropies of Ultrathin $Co(001)$ Films on
$Cu(001)$'' \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}, one can calculate that, for
$Co/Cu(001)$, $1\ut{ML} = (166\pm{}36)\ut{pm}$, whereas other workers
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:OMA, Weber:1996:SRM} state that
$1\ut{ML} \approx{} 180\ut{pm}$.}, as it becomes energetically
favourable to form dislocations to relieve the strain; the boundary of
``large thicknesses'' is \cite{Heinrich:1993:UMM} not thinner than
$10\ut{ML}$, and has been found \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} to vary between
$10\ut{ML}$ and $20\ut{ML}$, depending on the temperature at which the
film is deposited, although, at room temperature, substantial strain
remains \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} up to at least $40\ut{ML}$, and the
method used to measure the lattice parameter, and therefore the
strain, \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} suggests that the cobalt remains
face-centred cubic throughout; therefore, one would expect all but the
thinnest of the $Co$ films studied in this thesis, and possibly the
thinnest one as well, to be in the r\'egime where epitaxial growth has
begun to break down, in the sense of the lattice parameter departing
from that of copper.  For thicknesses greater than $1\ut{ML}$
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Smardz:1990:RTF, Ramsperger:1996:GSF} or
$2\ut{ML}$ \cite{Heinrich:1993:UMM, Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP,
Bland:1998:ASE}, and less than $10\ut{ML}$ \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF}, the
cobalt wets \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Smardz:1990:RTF,
Schmid:1993:FIT, Heinrich:1993:UMM, Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} the surface, growing
layer-by-layer, although this is not \cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF} the
case for $(1\,1\,17)$ mis-cut substrates.  The surface roughness of
the cobalt film, therefore, oscillates \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} as a
function of film thickness, with period $1\ut{ML}$.

Thin cobalt films on copper $(001)$ have a ferro-magnetic phase, for
(relatively) large thicknesses; the transition thickness $d_C$ has
been variously reported as being $1.75\ut{ML}$ at room temperature
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU}, as having a lower limit of $0.7\ut{ML}$ and
an upper limit of $(0.96\pm{}0.1)\ut{ML}$ \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF}, as
being $(1.6\pm{}0.3)\ut{ML}$ at room temperature
\cite{Krams:1992:MAU}. as being $(1.3\pm{}0.3)\ut{ML}$
\cite{Schumann:1994:PFP}, as being approximately $1.5\ut{ML}$
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO}, as being $(1.35\pm{}0.35)\ut{ML}$
\cite{Buckley:1996:VMP}, and as having a a lower limit of $1\ut{ML}$
and an upper limit of $1.7\ut{ML}$ \cite{Bland:1999:ASE}.  Where the
films are thin enough to be regarded as two-dimensional, the
ferro-magnetism cannot \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} be rendered stable by the
Weiss field alone, and some other effect, perhaps due to dipole-dipole
interactions or magnetic anisotropy, must \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} be
invoked to explain the ferro-magnetism.  For thicknesses slightly
greater than the critical thickness, the Curie temperature is
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} much lower than that for bulk cobalt, and
exhibits \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} a strong dependence on the film
thickness, varying \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} approximately linearly
from $125\ut{K}$ at $1.5\ut{ML}$ thickness to $575\ut{K}$ at
$3\ut{ML}$ thickness, compared with a bulk Curie temperature reported
as $1388\ut{K}$ \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} or $1392\ut{K}$
\cite{Wijn:1991:MPM}; imperfections in the film can
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} further suppress the Curie temperature.  The
magnetic susceptibility as a function of thickness obeys
\cite{Bland:1998:ASE} a power law consistent with ferro-magnetism
arising through a two-dimensional percolation transition; that is to
say, the susceptibility $\chi$, for thicknesses $d < d_C$, is
\cite{Schumann:1994:PFP} proportional to
$\left(1-\frac{d}{d_C}\right)^{-\gamma}$: two separate experiments
found \cite{Schumann:1994:PFP} $\gamma{} = 2.41\pm{}0.07$ and
$\gamma{} = 2.38\pm{}0.07$, which are \cite{Schumann:1994:PFP}
consistent with the theoretical prediction of $\gamma{} = 2.389$, for
a two-dimensional percolation phase transition, but rather less
consistent with the prediction of $\gamma{} = 1.66$, for a
three-dimensional percolation phase transition.  A percolation phase
transition occurs \cite{Schumann:1994:PFP}, as material (cobalt) is
added, when the concentration of atoms becomes sufficient for the
(short-range) exchange interaction to be transmitted throughout the
sample.

The magnetic anisotropy energy of $Co/Cu(001)$ films combines a
uni-axial term, which includes \cite{Heinrich:1993:UMM} an important
(but controversial \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}) contribution from epitaxial
strain, and which constrains \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Krams:1992:MAU,
Heinrich:1993:UMM, Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} the magnetization
to be in the plane of the film, i.e.~which renders in-plane
magnetization energetically favourable by \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}
$(920\pm{}180)\ut{\mu{}J}\ut{m}^{-2}$ of film surface area, with a
term of fourfold symmetry within the plane, favouring
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Heinrich:1993:UMM, Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP} magnetization along $<110>$ axes
within the plane of the film, over magnetization along $<100>$ axes
within the plane of the film, by $(55\pm{}3.75)\ut{kJ}\ut{m}^{-3}$ of
cobalt volume, less $(15.5\pm{}1.5)\ut{\mu{}J}\ut{m}^{-2}$ of film
surface area; however, the fact that the remnant magnetization along
$[110]$ is \cite{Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} smaller than the
saturation magnetization has been interpreted \cite{Weber:1996:MIO,
Weber:1996:OMA, Buckley:1996:VMP}, on the assumption, which is
\cite{Krams:1992:MAU} supported by Brillouin light scattering
measurements, of single-domain magnetization during the reversal
process (Stoner-Wohlfarth reversal,) along with other features
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO} of the shape of the $M$-$H$ loops, to mean that
the overall easy axes of the film depart \cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Buckley:1996:VMP} from $<110>$ due to an additional term, of twofold
symmetry within the plane of the film; this departure has
\cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF, Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP,
Bland:1998:ASE} been attributed to the effect of atomic steps on the
$Co$ surfaces, inherited from the pre-deposition $Cu$
surface\footnote{It is important to distinguish between this residual
roughness of an annealed substrate surface, and the much greater
roughness of as-sputtered substrates, which has been cited
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} as responsible for un-reproducible magnetic
properties in epitaxial films.}; the $1\ut{ML}$-period oscillation in
the surface roughness, as a function of film thickness, is
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:SRM, Bland:1998:ASE} matched by an
oscillation of the same period in this twofold-symmetric anisotropy
within the plane, as revealed \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} by the variation
of the coercive field with thickness; the oscillation of the coercive
field with thickness is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} superimposed on a
general increase in coercive field with increasing thickness, which
undergoes \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} a sudden change of slope at thickness
$2\ut{ML}$.  However, other workers \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} have
questioned the existence of the twofold-symmetric anisotropy within
the plane.  Any corresponding oscillation in the fourfold-symmetric
anisotropy within the plane is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} smaller than
$5\%$ of the average anisotropy.  Others \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU}
have also noted modification of the coercivity and other features of
the in-plane anisotropy, due to imperfections of the film.  However,
the possibility has also been acknowledged \cite{Bland:1998:ASE} that
the step edges suppress the remnant magnetization along $[110]$ not by
altering the film's magnetic anisotropy, but by acting as domain-wall
pinning sites, in a multi-domain structure, and scanning tunnelling
microscopy has revealed a surface topography around the steps, whose
shape anisotropy is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} not sufficient, of itself,
to explain the observed anisotropy oscillations, requiring the
invocation of either lattice distortion at the step edges and
magnetostriction, or anisotropic diffusion of cobalt atoms at the
steps; the former is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:SRM} supported
by electron diffraction measurements.  It could \cite{Weber:1996:MIO,
Weber:1996:OMA}, alternatively, be that the oscillation of magnetic
anisotropy with thickness results from an oscillation, with thickness,
in the spin-orbit interactions of the discrete states, forced on
electrons by confinement in a square potential well, formed by the
cobalt film's lower and upper surfaces; however, unlike the
surface-topography-based explanation, there is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO}
no independent evidence that this spin-orbit coupling varies with the
same, $1\ut{ML}$, period as the magnetic anisotropy.  As film
thickness is reduced to very small values, the magnetic anisotropy
vanishes \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}, at the same thickness where the film
ceases to be ferro-magnetic, supporting the idea that it is magnetic
anisotropy that stabilizes the ferro-magnetic state.  There is
\cite{Bland:1998:ASE} also a change in magnetic anisotropy when the
epitaxial structure starts to break down at large thicknesses; to be
more specific, when the epitaxial strain starts to be relieved with
increasing thickness, at \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} $\sim{}16\ut{ML}$, the
easy axes of the twofold-symmetric, in-plane anisotropy suddenly
rotate \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} through ninety degrees, and its magnitude
sharply increases \cite{Weber:1996:SRM}, while, simultaneously, the
magnitude of the coercive field sharply increases
\cite{Weber:1996:SRM}, although this has been interpreted
\cite{Weber:1996:SRM} as the effect of dislocations acting as domain
wall pinning sites, in a multi-domain structure, rather than as a
corresponding, sharp increase in the magnitude of the
fourfold-symmetric, in-plane anisotropy.  The amplitude of the
magnetic anisotropy energy is manifested in the coercive field, which
has been given \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} as
$(6.4\pm{}1.1)\ut{kA}\ut{m}^{-1}$; this depends
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Bland:1998:ASE, Bland:1999:ASE} on
temperature, in a way which is attributed \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU,
Bland:1998:ASE, Bland:1999:ASE} to diffusion of copper atoms through
the cobalt film at elevated temperatures.  The twofold-symmetric
anisotropy within the plane can \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} also be altered
by growing the film in an applied magnetic field.

The saturation magnetizations of $Co/Cu(001)$ films, of all
thicknesses where the films are ferro-magnetic, are
\cite{Krams:1992:MAU, Weber:1996:SRM} within $5\%$ of the
$1.424\ut{MA}\ut{m}^{-1}$ \cite{Krams:1992:MAU, Weber:1996:SRM}
saturation magnetization of bulk cobalt.  The saturation magnetization
increases \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} with increasing film thickness.

It will be enlightening to recapitulate what this literature review
has revealed about two key questions.  Firstly, are the relatively
thick (between $(2.57\pm{}0.36)\ut{nm}$ and $(17.1\pm{}2.4)\ut{nm}$,
i.e.~between $\sim{}15\ut{ML}$ and $\sim{}100\ut{ML}$) cobalt films
used for the new experimental study, presented in this thesis, really
epitaxial?  The literature \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} reveals that only the
thinnest one of these seven films has the possibility of being
perfectly epitaxial, in the sense of adopting both the face-centred
cubic structure of the copper substrate and the copper lattice
parameter; the same paper reveals that the one further film with a
thickness below $40\ut{ML}$ ($6.6\ut{nm}$) will still be epitaxial in
the sense of having a face-centred cubic structure, but will have a
lattice parameter somewhere between the strain-free lattice parameters
of copper and cobalt.  The literature does not provide any direct
information on the structure of the five thicker films, but the
intuitive extrapolation is that the trend of remaining face-centred
cubic, but having a lattice parameter that gradually approaches the
strain-free lattice parameter of cobalt, will continue as the
thickness increases beyond $40\ut{ML}$.  Certainly, all the low-energy
electron diffraction patterns from $Co/Cu(001)$, which the present
author (sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction with colleagues) has
observed, have been characteristic of a face-centred cubic structure,
but the thickest of the films we examined in this way was
$(1.5\pm{}0.26)\ut{nm} \approx{} 9\ut{ML}$, and therefore sheds little
light on this discussion.

Secondly, what is the magnetic easy axis of the films?  It seems
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Krams:1992:MAU, Heinrich:1993:UMM,
Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} certain to be in-plane, but where
within the plane?  Other workers \cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:OMA, Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} have
found the easy axis to depart from the $<110>$ directions favoured by
the fourfold-symmetric anisotropy, in a way that is controlled by the
detailed surface topography of the substrate, and which, therefore,
varies from sample to sample.  The copper substrate crystal used in
the experiments herein presented was the same one that was used in
``Variations in the magnetic properties of ultrathin $Co$ films due to
the adsorption of non-magnetic metal atoms at the $Co$/vacuum
interface'' \cite{Buckley:1996:VMP}, where the easy axis of the cobalt
films was found to be $[100]$.  For this reason, the sample was
magnetized, and the reflected electron beam polarization measured,
along $[100]$, in the experiments herein presented.  However, there is
some cause for caution: the substrate crystal has been polished since
the published results on its easy axis were obtained, and those
published results were obtained at rather smaller cobalt thicknesses
than those used herein, whereas it is \cite{Weber:1996:SRM,
Bland:1998:ASE} possible for the easy axis direction to vary with
thickness.  Therefore, the most useful guide to the easy axis
direction is likely to be provided by $B$-$H$ loops for films in the
relevant thickness range, measured using the magneto-optical Kerr
effect (MOKE,) by one of the author's colleagues, using a rig
developed jointly by the author and colleagues, during a polarized
electron reflection experiment (section \ref{july-2002-experiments},)
conducted jointly by the author and the colleague in question.  These
loops are shown in figure \ref{moke}.  Two features of the loops for
non-zero thicknesses are crucial.  Firstly, the remnant magnetization
along $[100]$ is almost as large as the saturation magnetization,
confirming both that there is a minimum of the magnetic anisotropy
energy, with respect to magnetization direction, when the
magnetization is along $[100]$, and that the remnant state of the
cobalt film is almost single-domain.  Secondly, the magnetization
appears to reverse all at once, rather than in multiple steps,
suggesting that this energy minimum is the global minimum,
i.e.~$[100]$ is \emph{the} easy axis.

Having summarized the present state of knowledge concerning
$Co/Cu(001)$, it is time to review some published polarized electron
reflection studies.

\section[The Experimental Context]{Other Workers' Published
  Experimental Data on the Spin Polarization of Reflected Electron
  Beams}
\label{experimental-context}

Although the author is familiar with several examples
\cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP,
Kirschner:1985:IES, Landolt:1985:SPS, Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG,
Lind:1987:SSA, Smardz:1990:RTF, Weber:1999:EAF} of published data,
obtained using Mott polarimeters, on the spin polarization of
reflected, diffracted, transmitted, inelastic, and secondary electron
beams, from magnetic and non-magnetic materials, rather few of them
\cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP,
Smardz:1990:RTF} concern specular reflection.  Unfortunately, these
include only one \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF} of the publications, in which
copper \cite{Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG, Lind:1987:SSA,
Smardz:1990:RTF} or cobalt \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF, Weber:1999:EAF}
samples are used.  Nevertheless, other workers' specular reflection
experiments on metallic surfaces can be compared, at least
qualitatively, with the new theory of this chapter, and with the
published theories reviewed in this chapter.

Measurements of reflected beam polarization from a tungsten $(001)$
surface, as a function of incident electron energy and angle of
incidence, have been reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP}.  No error
estimates are given\footnote{However, some idea can be obtained from
the level of reproducibility between different laboratories.},
rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of theories
quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, it is easy to imagine
that the random errors are large enough that, except in some narrow
($\sim{}20\ut{eV}$,) resonance-like energy bands, the measurements are
consistent with the energy-independent, angle-independent, zero
polarization predicted in the new theory of this chapter.  One of the
narrow energy bands includes $82\ut{eV}$, allowing the measurements to
be simultaneously consistent with the band-structure calculation for
tungsten, mentioned earlier in this chapter.  It could be conjectured
that the narrow energy bands correspond to changes in wave-vector on
reflection, which, in some sense, match the repeat distance of those
parts of the atomic cores, which are of sufficiently deep potential to
render the electrons' kinetic energy comparable with their rest mass
energy, allowing spin-orbit polarizing effects to become significant,
and removing these narrow energy bands from the domain of validity of
the new theory in this chapter.  Some of the published band-structure
calculations, reviewed earlier in this chapter, appear to have
captured phenomena of this type.

Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a $Cu_3Au$ $(001)$ surface, as a function of
incident beam energy, at an angle of incidence of $13\ut{^{\circ}}$.
In the energy region above $\sim{}60\ut{eV}$, where the Taylor
expansion allows the new theory of this chapter to make quantitative
predictions, the measurements appear to tend rapidly with increasing
incident energy, to the constant, zero polarization of this theory.

The same paper \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} goes on to review measurements
of reflected beam polarization from a nickel $(001)$ surface, as a
function of incident beam energy and angle of incidence, as does
another paper \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP} in the same collection.  For
the former data set, in the energy region above $\sim{}60\ut{eV}$,
where the Taylor expansion allows the new theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context} to make quantitative predictions, the
measurements provide a very good match to the constant polarization
this theory.  However, they provide an approximately equally good
match to the relevant, published band-structure calculation, reviewed
earlier in this chapter.  For philosophical reasons explained
elsewhere \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, the author is inclined to assign a
higher prior probability to the new theory of this chapter than to the
band-structure theory, leading to the former being preferred in this
case of roughly equal goodness of fit.  However, prior probabilities
are \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} subjective, and readers are, therefore,
fully entitled to disagree.  The latter data set, which uses an
estimator of the polarization designed to reveal only exchange
effects, not spin-orbit effects, is a rather better match to the
constant polarization, predicted by the new theory of this chapter,
than to any of several band-structure theories, reviewed in that
chapter.

Measurements of reflected beam polarization from an iron $(110)$
surface, as a function of incident electron energy and angle of
incidence, have been reviewed \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP}.  No error
estimates are given\footnote{However, some idea can be obtained from
the level of reproducibility between different laboratories.},
rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of theories
quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, it is easy to imagine
that the random errors are large enough that the measurements are
consistent with the energy-independent, angle-independent, possibly
non-zero polarization predicted in the new theory of this chapter.
However, the relevant band-structure theories, reviewed earlier in
this chapter, provide approximately an equally good fit.

  of This Chapter Predicts an Energy-Independent Polarization.}
\label{copied-experiment-figure}
\end{figure}

Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a platinum $(111)$ surface, as a function of
the orientation of the scattering plane, relative to the crystal axes,
at an incident electron energy of $60\ut{eV}$, and an angle of
incidence of $43.5\ut{^{\circ}}$.  Again, no error estimates are
given, rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of
theories quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, visually,
the results appear to provide a superb match to the predictions of a
band-structure calculation for this material, reviewed earlier in this
chapter \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP}, and a very dubious match to the zero
polarization predicted by the new theory of this chapter.  Because the
measurements were all taken at the same beam energy, the conjecture
above, regarding narrow energy bands that are outside the domain of
validity of the new theory in this chapter, might apply.

Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a gold $(110)$ surface, as a function of angle
of incidence and temperature, at an incident electron energy of
$50\ut{eV}$.  Once again, no error estimates are given, rendering it
impossible to judge the relative merits of theories quantitatively, by
these measurements.  However, it does appear that there are
substantial polarizations (up to $0.6$,) which vary with angle of
incidence.  At energies as low as $50\ut{eV}$, the lowest-order Taylor
expansion in the inverse energy, which is used in the new theory of
this chapter, is becoming dubious, and it is therefore not clear what
this theory predicts, but if the Taylor expansion were valid, it would
predict zero polarizations for all angles of incidence.  Because the
measurements were all taken at the same beam energy, the conjecture
above, regarding narrow energy bands that are outside the domain of
validity of the new theory in this chapter, might apply.

Since the bulk of this thesis was completed, the author has also
become aware of published experimental data \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF} on
the spin polarization of a reflected electron beam from a $Co/Cu(001)$
film; the experiment was undertaken at a incident electron energy of
$17\ut{eV}$, and for a range of thicknesses up to $\sim{}2.5\ut{ML}$;
the intention was to detect the onset of ferro-magnetism with
increasing thickness.  Both the thicknesses and the beam energy are
considerably lower than those studied in the new experiments presented
in this thesis; therefore, the results are not directly comparable.
At the onset of ferro-magnetism, a jump was observed from a spin
polarization of zero to an ``asymmetry'' of $\sim{}0.19$.  It is not
clear whether this ``asymmetry'' represents an absolute polarization,
or whether it requires calibration with something akin to a detector
Sherman function.

\section[Repeated Adaptation List]{List of Adaptations to the
  Polarimeter, and to the Measurement Technique, from \emph{Mott
    Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory} \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}}
\label{repeated-adaptation-list}

Mott polarimetry involves substantial technical difficulties.  There
follows a list of difficulties that were encountered with the
Cavendish polarimeter, and measures that were taken to overcome them,
in order to allow the experiments described in this thesis to proceed.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Significant cross-talk was discovered between the signal output
  cables on the two channeltrons; this was largely eliminated by the
  installation of improved shielding within the polarimeter.
\item{}The high voltage supply used to accelerate the electrons toward
  the thorium target was found to be unreliable; there was a
  considerable delay in the diagnosis of this fault due to the
  difficulty of finding a reasonably safe means of measuring the
  required potential difference of many $\ut{kV}$.  Once the supply
  had been discovered to be producing only $750\ut{V}$, replacement of
  the offending control potentiometer was rapidly effected.
\item{}The channeltrons are \cite{::CEM} designed as single-electron
  counting devices, intended to function by using an electrostatic
  field to accelerate an incoming electron into a collision, which
  liberates further electrons from the channeltron walls, which are in
  turn accelerated to produce further collisions.  This process
  amplifies a single electron into a current pulse containing
  $\sim{}10^8$ electrons, which is readily detectable using a digital
  counter.  However, the count rates measured by this method were
  found to be anomalously low.  This is believed to be because the
  rate, at which electrons were arriving at the channeltrons, was
  substantially above the saturation rate ($\sim{}10^4\ut{Hz}$,) at
  which the channeltrons' detection efficiency begins to drop rapidly
  with increasing electron arrival rate.  This was the case with
  specularly reflected beams of energies between $\sim{}2\ut{keV}$ and
  $\sim{} 3\ut{keV}$ from magnetic and non-magnetic surfaces, even for
  the smallest incident beam currents available.  Therefore, it was
  necessary to make adaptations to allow the use of the front ends of
  the channeltrons as Faraday cups, the current collected at which
  could be measured as a continuous flow, rather than as discrete
  electron arrival events.  To this end, an ammeter of sufficient
  sensitivity to measure the currents involved (of order $1pA$) was
  procured, and a wire which connected the front ends of the two
  channeltrons, possibly allowing flow of current between them, was
  removed.
\item With the high voltage supply to the thorium foil in operation,
  continuous current measurement revealed current spikes, occurring at
  a frequency of $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$, peaking at what later transpired to
  be approximately the steady current, which was obtained in
  successful measurements.  The spikes were set against a background
  of substantially lower current, and were also detected as pulses in
  single electron counting mode, whether or not an accelerating
  potential difference was applied across the channeltrons.  This is
  now believed to have been a consequence of the electrical connection
  to the thorium foil and surrounding assembly from outside the vacuum
  chamber having some freedom of movement inside its insulating
  casing, leading to a situation in which there was good electrical
  contact only for brief periods, occurring at $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$,
  producing the spikes that represented the current in the intended
  operating condition.  The effect has disappeared since the
  mechanical security of the connection was improved.
\item Calculation of raw asymmetries
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},+} = \frac{f_{+,1}-f_{+,2}}{f_{+,1}+f_{+,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},-} = \frac{f_{-,1}-f_{-,2}}{f_{-,1}+f_{-,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
from the measurements \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} on the reflected beam
from $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ shows larger uncertainties, and slightly
poorer consistency between the two runs of the experiment than the
results from the use of the formula (equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}) for the elimination of
multiplicative systematic errors, suggesting that the multiplicative
errors do exist, and were subject to drift over the period between the
two runs of the experiment, and that the use of the formula, with the
polarization reversal achieved using opposite remanent magnetization
directions of the film structure, was a necessary measure.
\item The difficulty of adjusting the zero on the ammeter used for
  continuous current measurements, given its slow response both to the
  zeroing control and to changes in the current which it was
  measuring, led to a suspicion that there might be additive offsets
  which would require a fitting procedure of the kind introduced in
  \emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
  \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  The non-zero and variable values obtained
  for the channeltron currents at zero incident beam current, using
  this procedure, indicate that such offsets do exist, and are subject
  to drift; therefore, both the fitting procedure and the time
  ordering of the experiments were necessary precautions.
\end{itemize}

Earlier, when this chapter's new, classical-field theory of polarized
electron reflection was outlined, it was promised that the full
algebraic details of that theory would follow.  These are presented in
the next section.

\section[PER Theory]{Theory of Polarized Electron Reflection: Full
  Algebraic Details}
\label{per-supplement}
\subsection[Amplitude Reflection Coefficient]{Amplitude Reflection
  Coefficient for an Electron Pure State, at a Single Step in Electric
  Potential and Magnetic Flux Density}

The incident and transmitted electron waves are modelled (figure
\ref{single_step}) as plane waves, allowing the well-defined
wave-vector components $p$ in the plane of the interface, and $q_i$
perpendicular to the interface.  $p$ must be the same for all the
waves, in order to satisfy the boundary condition of continuity of the
wave-function at the interface.  The amplitude reflection coefficient
is \cite{Rae:1992:QM}
\begin{equation}
r_{01} = \frac{q_0-q_1}{q_0+q_1}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
or, for a general interface,
\begin{equation}
r_{ij} = \frac{q_i-q_j}{q_i+q_j}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Next, I need to build an expression for the energy of the electrons.
There will be kinetic energy terms, which, in the non-relativistic
limit, are
\[
\frac{\hbar^2p^2}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\]
and
\[
\frac{\hbar^2q_i^2}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\]
along with an electrostatic potential energy
\[
-eV_i\pnc{,}
\]
and a term due to the torque, on the electron magnetic moment, in a
magnetic field \cite{Rae:1992:QM}
\[
\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\]
where $S_i$ is the angle between the electron spin and the magnetic
flux density.  The form of this last term assumes a well-defined
energy for all values of $S_i$.  Strictly, only certain $S_i$ values
are eigen-states of a Hamiltonian which includes a magnetic field;
more about this later (section \ref{incomplete}.)  The total energy is
\begin{equation}
E =
\frac{\hbar^2p^2}{2m_e}+\frac{\hbar^2q_i^2}{2m_e}-eV_i+\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
or, where $p$ is expressed as a fraction $\sin{}I$ of the total wave-number
in the absence of any potential, $I$ being an angle of incidence like
that in figure \ref{dhatton1},
\begin{equation}
E = E\sin^2I+\frac{\hbar^2q_i^2}{2m_e}-eV_i+\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_e}
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
\Rightarrow{}q_i & = &
\left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}\left(1+\frac{eV_i}{E\cos^2I}-\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_eE\cos^2I}\right)^{1/2}\br
& = & \left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}(1+x_i)^{1/2}\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x_i = y_i+z_i\cos{}S_i$, $y_i = \frac{eV_i}{E\cos^2I}$, and
$z_i = -\frac{e\hbar{}B_i}{2m_eE\cos^2I}$.

I now use a binomial expansion \cite{Gallagher::MFH} for the case
where the potential energy terms are much smaller than the total
electron energy, where the dimensionless numbers I've just devised
are small.  The magnetic term associated with the Weiss field in a
ferromagnet is \cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP} a few tenths of an
electron-volt, and the electrostatic contact potentials in the metals
which I study will not be more than a few volts, whereas, in my
experimental set-up, the incident electron energies range from a few
hundred to a few thousand electron volts, so this approximation seems
reasonable.
\begin{eqnarray}
q_i & = & \left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}\left(1+\frac{1}{2}x_i-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2+O(x_i^3)\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

The amplitude reflection coefficient is, therefore,
\begin{eqnarray}
r_{ij} & = &
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x_i-\frac{1}{2}x_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)\br
& & \times\left(1+\frac{1}{4}x_i+\frac{1}{4}x_j-\frac{1}{16}x_i^2-\frac{1}{16}x_j^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)^{-1}\br
& = &
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x_i-\frac{1}{2}x_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)\br

\subsection[Unpolarized Beam]{Reflection of an Unpolarized Beam from the
  Surface of a Bulk Magnetic Sample}
\label{bulk-details}

An unpolarized incident electron beam is \cite{Kessler:1976:PE,
  Kessler:1985:PE} an incoherent superposition of pure states
  representing all directions of the incident spin.  Each such
  direction can be represented by its spherical polar angle
  co-ordinates $(\theta{},\phi{})$.  That is to say, the incident beam
  contains a flux of electrons
\begin{equation}
F_1\td{\theta}\td{\phi} = A\sin\theta\td{\theta}\td{\phi}
\end{equation}
with polarization direction between $\theta$ and
$\theta{}+\td{\theta}$, and between $\phi$ and $\phi{}+\td{\phi}$.
The flux of such electrons in the reflected beam will, therefore, be
\begin{equation}
\label{reflected-amplitude}
F_2\td{\theta}\td{\phi} = |r_{ij}|^2F_1\td{\theta}\td{\phi}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The reflection from the surface of a bulk sample is to be modelled as
a single reflection, of amplitude reflection coefficient $r_{01}$, in
a situation where $V_0$, $B_0$, and therefore $x_0$, are all zero.  In
this case,
\begin{equation}
r_{01} = -\frac{1}{4}x_1+\frac{1}{8}x_1^2+O(x_1^3)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
|r_{01}|^2 = \frac{1}{16}x_1^2-\frac{1}{16}x_1^3+O(x_1^4)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
assuming that $r_{01}$ is real.

If the spherical polar representation $(\theta_i,\phi_i)$ is used for
the direction of the magnetic flux density in region $i$, then
\begin{equation}
\cos{}S_i = \sin\theta_i\cos\phi_i\sin\theta\cos\phi{}+\sin\theta_i\sin\phi_i\sin\theta\sin\phi{}+\cos\theta_i\cos\theta\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
x_i = y_i+z_i(\sin\theta_i\cos\phi_i\sin\theta\cos\phi{}+\sin\theta_i\sin\phi_i\sin\theta\sin\phi{}+\cos\theta_i\cos\theta{})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The polarization of the pure state represented by $(\theta{},\phi{})$,
in the Cartesian co-ordinate system associated with this spherical
polar system, is
\begin{equation}
\vc{P}(\theta{},\phi{}) =
(\sin\theta\cos\phi{},\sin\theta\sin\phi{},\cos\theta{})\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and the average polarization of the reflected beam is
\begin{eqnarray}
\vc{P} & = &
\frac{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}\vc{P}(\theta{},\phi{})F_2\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}F_2\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}\br

& = &
\frac{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}(\sin\theta\cos\phi{},\sin\theta\sin\phi{},\cos\theta{})\left(\frac{1}{16}x_1^2-\frac{1}{16}x_1^3+O(x_1^4)\right)\sin\theta\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}\left(\frac{1}{16}x_1^2-\frac{1}{16}x_1^3+O(x_1^4)\right)\sin\theta\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}\br
& = & \frac{(I_2-I_6,I_3-I_7,I_4-I_8)+O(\{y_1,z_1\}^4)}{I_1-I_5+O(\{y_1,z_1\}^4)}\pnc{.}

\section{Theoretical Physics of Mott Polarimetry}

Mott polarimetry is a means of measuring the spin polarization of an
electron beam, and finds its most frequent application in
photo-emission spectroscopy \cite{Heinzmann:1990:} and the study of
surfaces, thin films and multi-layers \cite{Mulhollan:1992:LDS}.  The
latter is the application with which this thesis is primarily
concerned.  Mott polarimeters are based on the left-right asymmetry in
the scattering of polarized electrons by atoms, i.e. the relative
difference in scattering cross-section between scattering events
through the same angle in opposite senses (equation \ref{xsec},) and
its use as an indicator of the incident beam's spin polarization
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Common choices of scatterer for Mott
polarimeters are gold, thorium and uranium foils \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP}.  All of these have high proton numbers $Z$,
leading to a large spin-dependent potential correction (equation
\ref{spinorb}.)  Thorium and uranium provide a value of total
scattering cross-section $\sigma _0$ (equation \ref{xsec}) which is
around $15\%{}$ greater than that for gold \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP} and an analysing power $S$ (equation \ref{xsec})
which is improved by between $10\%{}$ and $20\%{}$
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP} or even as much as $30\%{}$
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP}.  On the other hand, thorium and uranium have the
disadvantage that their chemical reactivity renders them more
sensitive than gold to atmospheric contaminants, which may reduce both
overall cross-section and Sherman function (section \ref{crosssec})
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  For the polarimeter used in
this project, a thorium foil has been chosen (figure \ref{sd}.)

\subsection{The Spin-Dependence of the Scattering Potential}
\label{so}

The differential cross-section as a function of scattering angle in
Mott scattering, i.e.  the scattering of electrons by nuclei at small
impact parameters, exhibits a dependence on the electron spin
direction \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  As Kessler
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} points out, in addition to
simplifying the potential calculation, the use of small impact
parameters, i.e. high energies and large scattering angles, increases
the analysing power of the polarimeter, as a result of the
$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}$ dependence of the spin-orbit correction
(equation \ref{spinorb}.)  The mechanism for this can be understood
classically, as the additional, position-dependent term in the
scattering potential, resulting from the torque exerted on the
electron's spin magnetic moment, by the magnetic field due to the
presence of a moving, charged nucleus in the electron's rest frame
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Gay \& Dunning
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP} and Dunning \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP} have developed
a quantitative version of this model for a single scattering nucleus,
which results in the expression for the spin-dependent potential
contribution
\begin{equation}
\label{spinorb}
V_{so}'=\frac{Ze\mu _B\mathbf{L}.\mathbf{S}}{8\pi\epsilon _0\hbar
m_ec^2|\mathbf{r}|^3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is the proton number of the nucleus, $\mu _B$ is the Bohr
magneton, $\mathbf{L}$ is the orbital and $\mathbf{S}$ the spin
angular momentum of the electron, in the rest frame of the nucleus,
and $\mathbf{r}$ is the displacement of the electron from the nucleus.
This potential form is equivalent to the fine splitting by the
spin-orbit interaction familiar from the analysis of bound electronic
states in atomic physics \cite{Gasiorowicz:1996:QP}.  Kessler
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} also makes some helpful
comments on this model.

\subsection[Cross-Section]{Spin-Dependence of the Scattering Cross-Section}
\label{crosssec}

By subjecting the general solution of the Dirac equation for a central
potential to the condition that the electron wave-function is a
superposition of a plane incident wave with a spherical (in wavefront
geometry, not necessarily in the symmetry of the scattered amplitude)
scattered wave, Kessler \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} finds it
possible to express the effect of a spin-dependent potential
correction on the scattering cross-section $\sigma $ (whether
differential or integrated over a particular solid angle) as
\begin{equation}
\label{xsec}
\sigma =\sigma _0(1+SP)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma _0$ and $S$ are functions of the incident electron
energy $E_b$, and of the scattering angle $\theta $, and $P$ is the
component of the spin polarization of the incident beam along the
normal to the scattering plane; that is to say, if the electrons were
forced to collapse into states of well-defined spin component along
this direction, the fractions with spin up $f_u$ and spin down $f_d$
would be such that
\begin{equation}
\label{polar}
P=f_u-f_d\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
$S$ is known as the asymmetry function \cite{Sherman:1956:CSR,
  Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}, the Sherman function
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE, Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP} or the analysing power \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP,
  Bertacco:1999:NES}.  The only assumption about the form of the
potential that was required to obtain this result was its separability
in spherical polar co-ordinates.  All the finer details of the
potential, be it that of a single atom (section \ref{so}) or that of a
metal foil of the kind found in a real polarimeter (figure \ref{sd},)
are contained in the functional forms of $\sigma _0$ and $S$.  In
particular, if there were no mechanism, of the kind described in
equation \ref{spinorb}, for spin-dependence in the scattering
potential, then $S$ would vanish.

Equation \ref{xsec} leads directly to the left-right asymmetry in
scattering of a polarized electron beam.  Two detectors are so placed
as to collect scattered electron beams with scattering angles of the
same magnitude, but in opposite senses (figure \ref{sd}.)  The
scattering plane normals for the two detectors are therefore in
opposite directions, i.e. the polarization component $P$ is of the
same magnitude but opposite sign at the two detectors.  For a
scatterer of even quite low symmetry, $S$ will be the same for both
detectors, with the result that the rates of electron arrival at the
two detectors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, will be \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
Dunning:1994:MEP}, from equation \ref{xsec}
\begin{equation}
\label{r1}
R_1 = R_0(1+SP)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{r2}
R_2 = R_0(1-SP)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
In the case of the compact retarding-potential polarimeter (figure
\ref{sd}, chapter \ref{compact},) it is possible to obtain $S$ for
some values of the energy of the incident electrons at the target and
the energy window defined by the retarding potential from look-up
tables \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}.  Combining equations \ref{r1} and
\ref{r2}, the polarization is
\begin{equation}
\label{asymmean}
P = \frac{R_1-R_2}{S(R_1+R_2)}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\section{The Instrument at the Cavendish Laboratory}

A Mott polarimeter has been available at the Cavendish Laboratory for
some time.  The main purpose of the polarimetry project to date has
been to increase its reliability as a measuring device to the point
where it can be used to determine the polarization of a reflected,
diffracted or secondary electron beam from an ultra-thin magnetic film
structure.  The latter has now been achieved using a specularly
reflected electron beam from a film structure that previous research
has suggested is of interest (chapter \ref{motive}.)  This has
required the finding of technical solutions to a variety of
instrumental difficulties \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} (sections
\ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)

The polarimeter now in use at the Cavendish Laboratory is of the
compact, retarding-potential type (figure \ref{sd})
\cite{Zhang:1991:LEE, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  The detector position is
chosen because there is a broad maximum in the Sherman function $S$,
defined above, for metal foils at a scattering angle of around
$120^{\circ}$ \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Electrons are focused onto the
thorium target by the electrostatic grids and lenses at the front of
the device (figure \ref{sd},) and are accelerated to energies between
$20\ut{keV}$ and $25\ut{keV}$, suitable for the required low impact
parameter scattering, by an electrostatic potential applied at the
thorium foil \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  An electrostatic potential
applied at the retarding grids (figure \ref{sd}) turns back electrons
which have lost more than some specified amount of energy, chosen by
setting the retarding grid potential, during the scattering process
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This eliminates a large proportion of
multiply scattered electrons, for which the Sherman function $S$ is
reduced, without the reduction in the total cross-section $\sigma _0$,
which is brought about by using a thin film target to reduce multiple
scattering \cite{Dunning:1987:UTG}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{polarimeter}}

  Polarimeter, $a$ the Fraction of Those Electrons that Are Accepted
  into the Polarimeter, and $H_i$ the Rate at which Electrons Are
  Scattered towards Channeltron $i$.}
\label{sd}
\end{figure}

The use of a retarding potential also means that the external
electrodes can all be kept grounded, with the obviation of the need
for bulky shielding on the detector as well as the direct safety
benefits \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This, coupled with the relatively
small target potential of $\sim{}22\ut{kV}$, which restricts the
inter-electrode distances needed to avoid electrical breakdown, keeps
the instrument small (the distance between the two channeltrons is
$\sim{}10\ut{cm}$) \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}, which is convenient for
its attachment to a vacuum chamber (chapter \ref{chamber-chapter}) for
experiments and for development and maintenance.  In addition, the
closeness of the channeltrons to the target, and the large solid angle
which they therefore subtend, allows for a high total scattering
cross-section $\sigma_0$ (equation \ref{xsec})
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  The relatively low energy of electrons
incident on the thorium foil (figure \ref{sd}) also increases $\sigma
_0$.

\subsection{The Channeltron}

The nature of the channeltron is presented in figure \ref{channeltron}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{channeltron}}
\htmladdimg{./channeltron.png}
\caption{A Channeltron}
\label{channeltron}
\end{figure}
The functioning of the device in electron-counting mode is described
in detail in its manual \cite{::CEM}.  It can also be operated in a
continuous current measurement mode, with a small, positive collector
voltage and a sensitive ammeter connected to its front end.

An electron source is also needed for the experiments; for this, a
commercial electron gun is used.  The experiments in section
\ref{method} and section \ref{july-2002-experiments} used a temporary
replacement electron gun, since the gun that had been used for the
experiments in section \ref{autumn-2001-experiments} had
malfunctioned.  An unfortunate consequence of a slight geometrical
incompatibility, between the temporary replacement electron gun and
the vacuum chamber (chapter \ref{chamber-chapter},) was that
low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy
measurements were not possible, while the temporary gun was in place;
it was therefore necessary to rely on previous calibrations (sections
\ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{auger-maths},) for the kind of
information that these techniques would have produced.

Both the temporary replacement electron gun, and the gun procured by
the author's predecessors, are described in detail in their respective
manuals \cite{:1997:UME, :1978:LAE}.

The Mott polarimeter is an unusual, and relatively novel, instrument,
and with its measurements are associated particular systematic errors;
there follow descriptions of these, and of some established
experimental and mathematical techniques for eliminating them.

\section{Systematic Errors Specific to Mott Polarimetry}
\label{specific}

Gay and Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP} identify two sources of systematic
error unique to Mott polarimeters:
\begin{itemize}
\item The incoming electron beam may be misaligned (figure
\ref{misalign}.)
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{misalign}}
\htmladdimg{./misalign.png}
\caption{A Misaligned Incident Electron Beam.  Based on a diagram by
Gay \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP}}
\label{misalign}
\end{figure}
\item The two detectors may have efficiencies $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$,
which are less than unity.  More crucially for asymmetry measurements
(equation \ref{asymmean},) it may be that $\eta_1\neq\eta_2$.
\end{itemize}

Gay \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP} show that each of these effects
introduces a multiplicative relative systematic error in the electron
arrival rate at one channeltron compared with that at the other, which
invalidates the use of the raw asymmetry as a polarization indicator
(equation \ref{asymmean}.)  A technique has been developed
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP} which allows the elimination of
a systematic error of this nature.  In this scenario, the rates of
electron arrival $R_{ij}$ on channeltrons $i=1$ and $i=2$ for beams of
polarizations of equal magnitude $|P|$, in opposite directions
$j=\uparrow{}$ and $j=\downarrow{}$.  The polarization is then
given\footnote{In real experiments, the values of $R_{1\uparrow}$,
  $R_{1\downarrow}$, $R_{2\uparrow}$, and $R_{2\downarrow}$ are not
  perfectly specified, but are subject to significant random errors.
  In this case, the polarization obtained from equation \ref{rev}
  becomes an estimator; a given measurement will provide a
  polarization value, via the formula, which will not always be equal
  to the true value of the polarization, but whose value will be drawn
  from some probability distribution
  $P(P_{\textrm{formula}}|P_{\textrm{true}})$ about the true value.
  Frequentist statisticians might wish to ask whether it is an
  unbiased estimator, i.e.~whether the expectation of this probability
  distribution is equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$.  An answer could be
  particularly difficult to derive, given the non-linearity of
  $P_{\textrm{formula}}$ in the directly measured electron arrival
  rates.  Bayesian statisticians might prefer to abandon the
  estimator, and think in terms of the simpler forward probability
  distribution
  $P(R_{1\uparrow},R_{1\downarrow},R_{2\uparrow},R_{2\downarrow}|R_0,P_{\textrm{true}})$,
  using Bayes' theorem to invert it to
  $P(R_0,P_{\textrm{true}}|R_{1\uparrow},R_{1\downarrow},R_{2\uparrow},R_{2\downarrow})$}
by \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}
\begin{equation}
\label{rev}
P =
\frac{\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}-\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}}}{S(\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}+\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}})}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Derivation and Explanation of Equation \ref{rev}}
\label{explain}

Why would one expect this formula to work?  The underlying principle
is the time-honoured one of making two measurements, in which the
systematic error is of the same magnitude, but in opposite senses,
then taking an average of the two measurements, to obtain a result
free of systematic error.  However, because the systematic errors
under consideration here are multiplicative, rather than additive,
``average'' indicates geometric mean, rather than arithmetic mean.
The application of this principle in the present case will now be
examined in greater detail.

Let $\eta_i$ be the sensitivity (quantum efficiency) of detector $i$.
The two sources of multiplicative systematic error mentioned above can
be defined as conditions where $\eta_1 \neq{} \eta_2$, and where
$\td{s} \neq{} 0$, where the misalignment $\td{s}$ is as defined in
figure \ref{misalign}.  The measured electron arrival rate at detector
$i$, with incident polarization direction $j$, $R_{ij}$, is
\begin{equation}
R_{ij} = \eta_iQ_{ij}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $Q_{ij}$ is the actual rate at which electrons arrive at the
detector.

Let $\Theta_i$ be the solid angle subtended by detector $i$ at the point
where the electron beam strikes the thorium foil.  The scattering
probability per unit solid angle in the region of detector $1$ is
(equation \ref{r1}) $\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})$ for polarization
direction $\uparrow{}$, and $\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})$ for
polarization direction $\downarrow{}$, and vice versa (equation
\ref{r2}) in the region of detector $2$, i.e., if $Q_0$ is the rate at
which electrons are incident on the thorium foil,
\begin{equation}
Q_{1\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Q_{1\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Q_{2\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
Q_{2\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
R_{1\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\eta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{1\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\eta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{2\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\eta_2\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
R_{2\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\eta_2\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

If $A$ is the
cross-sectional area of a detector,
\begin{eqnarray}
\Theta_1 & = & \frac{A}{r_1^2}\br
& = & \frac{A}{(s+\td{s})^2+h^2}\br
& = & \frac{A}{s^2+h^2}\left(1+\frac{2s\td{s}+\td{s}^2}{s^2+h^2}\right)^{-1}\br
& \approx{} & \frac{A}{s^2+h^2}\left(1-\frac{2s\td{s}}{s^2+h^2}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
where $|\td{s}| \ll{} \frac{1}{2s(s^2+h^2)}$.  Similarly,
\begin{equation}
\Theta_2 \approx{}
\frac{A}{s^2+h^2}\left(1+\frac{2s\td{s}}{s^2+h^2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Some cumbersome notation can be avoided by defining $\Theta_0 =
\frac{A}{s^2+h^2}$ and $\td{\Theta} =\frac{2s\Theta_0\td{s}}{s^2+h^2}$.
Then
\begin{equation}
\Theta_1 = \Theta_0-\td{\Theta}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\Theta_2 = \Theta_0+\td{\Theta}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The polarization obtained from equation \ref{rev}, in the absence of
random errors, is therefore,
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\textrm{formula}} & = &
\frac{\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}-\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}}}{S(\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}+\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}})}\br
& = &
\left(\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right.\br
& &
\left.-\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right)\br
& &
/\left(\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right.\br
& & \left.+\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right)\br
& = & P_{true}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Additive Offsets}
\label{add}

Some systematic errors, instead of taking the form of a constant ratio
of measurements to true values, take the form of a constant difference
between measurements and true values; these systematic errors are
additive, not multiplicative.  During the experiments presented in
this thesis, the apparent electron arrival rates (chapter
\ref{results}) at the detectors, with the electron gun switched off,
and the conditions otherwise the same as in the real experiments, were
occasionally checked.  These rates should indicate the size of any
additive systematic error.  They were found to be of the order of
$1\ut{Hz}$, which is much smaller than the measured rates with the
electron gun on.  Additive systematic errors are, therefore, not
believed to be significant here.

\section{Drift Effects}

An empirically-based discussion of the possible effects of drift, in
the experiments presented in this thesis, can be found in section
\ref{july-2002-experiments}.  The measures taken to counter these
effects are discussed in section \ref{per-1-film}, and appendices
\ref{per-1-direction}, and \ref{per-1-channeltron}.

The technological principles of the vacuum maintenance equipment are
described in detail in \emph{Ultrahigh Vacuum Practice}
\cite{Weston:1985:UVP}, with useful additional information in ``vacuum
technology'' \cite{:1999:VT}.  The central portion of the vacuum
chamber, in which the sample holder (figure \ref{holder}) is situated,
is \cite{Hope:1997:SPR} constructed from $\mu$-metal, in order to
screen out external magnetic fields, while most of the peripheral
portions are constructed from stainless steel.  During the experiment
described in part \ref{main-experiment}, the chamber, and associated
equipment, maintained the gas pressure to which the sample was
exposed, at all times other than during argon ion sputtering, below
$(22\pm{}0.29)\times{}10^{-9}\ut{mbar}$, with a base pressure of
$(140\pm{}2.9)\times{}10^{-12}\ut{mbar}$.

There follow more detailed descriptions of the apparatus for sample
preparation, attached to the vacuum chamber.

\section{Sample Holder}
\label{holder-section}
The copper crystal, which forms the basis of the samples, is held in
the vacuum chamber (figures \ref{chamber-pumps}, \ref{chamber-prep})
on a sample holder (figure \ref{holder}.)
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics{holder}}
\htmladdimg{./holder.png}
\caption{The Sample Holder}
\label{holder}
\end{figure}
This sample holder provides the facility for moving the sample, with
two rotational degrees of freedom, and three translational degrees of
freedom.  It also provides heating for the sample, by means of the
power developed when a current is passed through the finite Ohmic
resistance of the heating wires, and measurement of the temperature of
the sample, and of a point slightly removed in space from the sample,
by means of the two thermocouples.

\section{Argon Ion Sputtering Gun}
\label{igs}

The chamber (figure \ref{chamber-prep}) contains an argon ion
sputtering gun, for use in cleaning the surface of the copper crystal.
The principles of this device are shown in figure \ref{igf}.
\begin{figure}
\latex{\includegraphics{igf}}
\htmladdimg{./igf.png}
\caption{Schematic Diagram of the Argon Ion Sputtering Gun}
\label{igf}
\end{figure}
The argon ion beam has a cleaning effect on the sample surface by
removing a surface layer.  The surface layer removal proceeds
\cite{Luntz:1999:RTE} by surface atoms and molecules, which are struck
by argon ions, recoiling into the bulk of the sample.  The elastic
response of the bulk of the sample then expels the surface atoms and
molecules.

As well as removing surface impurities, the author expects the
sputtering process to have removed the surface layer of amorphous
copper, which is \cite{Bowden:1967:FL} likely to have formed during
the polishing of the surface that took place, when the copper crystal
was temporarily removed from the vacuum chamber, between the
experiments in section \ref{autumn-2001-experiments} and those in
section \ref{july-2002-experiments}.

The gun was purchased commercially by the author's predecessors, and
is described in more detail in its manual \cite{:1991:OIA}.

\section{Electron-Beam Evaporators}
\label{evaporators}

Three electron-beam evaporators, for depositing cobalt, manganese, and
copper on the sample, are present in the vacuum chamber (figure
\ref{chamber-prep}.) Figure \ref{mn-evap-figure} shows the manganese
evaporator.

\caption{Schematic Diagram of the Manganese Evaporator}
\label{mn-evap-figure}
\end{figure}
This was chosen as the example evaporator, because the author is more
familiar with it than with the other two, having dismantled it to
replace the manganese charge and the cathode filament.

The heat generated by the current flowing in the cathode filament
excites electrons to leave the filament.  These are accelerated, by
the electric field, into the manganese (or cobalt or copper) charge,
where their kinetic energy is deposited as heat.  This evaporates some
of the manganese, producing a gas of manganese atoms and ions.  Those
that effuse from the exit hole are all travelling in roughly the same
direction, and therefore form an atom beam, which, if it strikes the
sample surface, deposits \cite{Wells:2001:TFM} a film of manganese on
that surface.

The manganese and copper evaporators were both constructed by the
author's predecessors, and are of very similar design.  The cobalt
evaporator, while working on the same principle, was purchased
commercially by the author's predecessors, and has the important
addition of a current collector, near its exit hole, which measures
the flux of ions, and therefore of atoms, leaving the exit hole.  This
is taken to be a measurement of the rate of cobalt deposition on the
sample.

The cobalt evaporator is described in more detail in its manual
\cite{:1992:IMU}.

Having described the vacuum chamber, and associated sample preparation
equipment, it is now time to present the methods by which this
equipment was used, in the experiments whose results are presented
later in this thesis.

\section{Method}
\label{method}

The purpose of this procedure is to measure the intensity and
polarization of the specularly reflected electron beam from
$Co/Cu(001)$, as a function of cobalt thickness, incident electron
energy, and incident electron beam current.  This description of the
procedure has been constructed in a modular way, in the sense that a
broad-brush view of the procedure is given, with references to later
sections, which give finer details of each step; there are several
levels of detail.  This section has been constructed in this unusual
fashion, because the author, aware of the general view that best
practice in computer programming is to arrange the instructions, which
describe what is to be done, in this fashion, is keen to investigate
whether the same principle applies to natural-language descriptions of
what has been done.  Some of the very fine details are to be found in
an appendix (appendix \ref{very-fine-method}.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The one of the two rotational motion drivers (section
  \ref{holder-section},) which had a horizontal axis of rotation,
  perpendicular to the surface of the $(001)$ copper crystal, was used
  to orient the $[100]$ axis of the crystal vertically within
  $5^{\circ}$, using visual inspection and a previous identification,
  by low-energy electron diffraction, of the orientation of the
  crystalline axes relative to the crystal's cut faces.
\item{}The $(001)$ copper crystal (section \ref{holder-section},) was
  cleaned in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (figure \ref{chamber-prep},)
  according to the procedure in section \ref{cleanup}, eight times.
  The reasons for choosing eight as the number of cycles are discussed
  in section \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}.  The resulting clean,
  well-ordered copper surface was named ``substrate 9,'' to continue
  the numbering sequence used in preliminary experiments (sections
  \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements were conducted,
  according to the procedure in section \ref{per-1-film}.
\item{}Cobalt was added to the sample, and the resulting film
  subjected to a series of polarized electron reflection measurements,
  according to the procedure in section \ref{grow-and-measure}, seven
  times.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Procedure for Cleaning the $Cu(001)$ Surface}
\label{cleanup}

The purpose of this procedure is to produce a sample surface which is
free of contaminants, and has a well-ordered crystalline structure.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The vacuum chamber's ion pump (figure \ref{chamber-pumps}) was
  isolated from the chamber using a gate valve, and switched off, to
  protect the pump from saturation with argon.
\item{}The sample was placed, according to the procedure in appendix
  \ref{place-sample}, in a position which had previously been
  determined as being in the
  path of the ion beam from a commercial argon ion sputtering gun
  (section \ref{igs},) with the sample's exposed $(001)$ face toward
  the gun.
\item{}The ion energy from the ion gun was set to
  $(2.8\pm{}0.029)\ut{keV}$.
\item{}The gas inlet valve of the ion gun was opened until the
  pressure in the chamber, as revealed by the ion gauge (figure
  \ref{chamber-pumps},) was $(875\pm{}110)\ut{pbar}$.
\item{}On some occasions, a visual check was made for a blue glow at
  the sample surface, which would confirm that the ion beam was
  reaching the surface.
\item{}The sputtering process was allowed to continue for
  $(59\pm{}9)\ut{minutes}$.
\item{}The gas inlet valve of the ion gun was closed.
\item{}The power supply that provided the ion energy was switched off.
\item{}When the pressure in the chamber, as revealed by the ion gauge
  (figure \ref{chamber-pumps},) had dropped to less than $1\ut{pbar}$,
  the ion pump was switched on.
\item{}The valve between the ion pump and the chamber was opened, and
  the ion pump was switched on.
\item{}A current of $(8.75\pm{}0.04)\ut{A}$, through the sample
  heating filament (figure \ref{holder},) was switched on.
\item{}When the sample temperature, as revealed by the sample
  thermocouple, exceeded $773\ut{K}$, the current through the sample
  heating filament was switched off.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[Growth and Measurement]{Procedure for Adding Cobalt to the
  Sample Surface and Conducting Polarized Electron Reflection
  Measurements}
\label{grow-and-measure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The sample was placed, according to the procedure in appendix
  \ref{place-sample}, in a position that had previously been
  determined, by observation of the resulting film with Auger electron
  spectroscopy \cite{Linsmeier:1994:AES, Linsmeier:1994:AESa,
  Childs:1995:HAE} (sections \ref{autumn-2001-experiments},
  \ref{auger-maths}), to lead to cobalt adsorption from a commercial
  electron-beam evaporator (section \ref{evaporators}), with respect
  to the translational dimensions, and $180^{\circ}$ from that
  position, with respect to rotation about a vertical axis.
\item{}The cobalt evaporator was switched on, and adjusted to give a
  flux monitor current $I_{mon}$ of $\sim{}30\ut{nA}$; a value of
  $I_{mon}$ with a quantitative precision estimate was recorded.
\item{}The sample was placed, according to the procedure in appendix
  \ref{place-sample}, into the position for cobalt adsorption, with
  respect to all degrees of freedom.
\item{}The shutter at the front of the evaporator was opened.
\item{}Cobalt was allowed to be adsorbed for a time $T$ of $\sim{}1\ut{ks}$; a
  value of $T$ with a precision estimate was recorded.
\item{}The shutter at the front of the evaporator was closed.
\item{}The evaporator was switched off.
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements were conducted,
  according to the procedure in section \ref{per-1-film}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Procedure for Conducting Polarized Electron Reflection
  Measurements on One Film}
\label{per-1-film}

The purpose of this procedure is to examine the sample's magnetic
properties with each of two opposite magnetization directions, with
the order in which the magnetizations are examined varying, to protect
against drift effects.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The vacuum chamber's ion pump (figure \ref{chamber-pumps}) was
  isolated from the chamber using a gate valve, and switched off, to
  protect the polarimeter from noise from the ion pump.
\item{}The vacuum chamber's ion gauge (figure \ref{chamber-pumps}) was
  switched off, to protect the polarimeter from noise from the ion
  gauge.
\item{}The sample was magnetized, according to the procedure in
  appendix \ref{magnetize-sample}.  If the procedure being described
  here had been performed previously, then the direction chosen for
  the magnetization was opposite to that chosen, at the same stage, in
  the preceding performance of this procedure.  Otherwise, a direction
  was chosen at random.
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements, as a function of
  incident electron energy and incident beam current, were taken,
  according to the procedure in appendix \ref{per-1-direction}.
\item{}The sample was magnetized, according to the procedure in
  appendix \ref{magnetize-sample}, in the opposite direction from that
  chosen at the earlier stage in this procedure.
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements were taken,
  according to the procedure in appendix \ref{per-1-direction}.
\item{}The ion gauge was switched on.
\item{}The ion pump was switched on.
\item{}The valve between the ion pump and the chamber was opened.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{results}

There follow measurements, using a reflected electron beam from
several cobalt thicknesses, of the electron arrival rates at the two
detectors of the Mott polarimeter.  The measurement run for each
cobalt thickness took place over a period of approximately
$2\ut{hours}$, the total duration of the experiments being
$5\ut{days}$.  The measurements were made at room temperature.

The recorded ion fluxes and durations of the cobalt growth sessions
are presented in table \ref{recorded-growth-conditions}.

Each point in the graphs represents a rate taken as the quotient of
the number of electrons counted in the time period $256\tau$, in the
relevant conditions, and $256\tau$.  The quoted uncertainty in the
detection rate is the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution
\cite{Boas:1983:MMP}.  In addition to these points, theoretical curves
are shown.  These represent the new theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, as expanded to take account of instrumental
characteristics, by the main model of section
\ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.  For the purposes of the curves in
this chapter, the parameters are chosen, using the Marquardt-Levenberg
algorithm, for the best possible fit to the data.  The parameters
affect the goodness of fit, through three parameter combinations, each
of which includes a mixture of characteristics of the sample and of
the instrument.  The most interesting of these combinations, by virtue
of being free of un-calibrated instrumental characteristics, is the
Mott asymmetry $SP =
-\frac{4Se^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}$, which
represents the balance between the electric potential $V_1$ and the
Weiss field $B_1$, inside the sample.  The best-fit values of the Mott
asymmetry, for each film thickness, are set out in table
\ref{best-fit-asymmetries}.  From a visual inspection of published
calibration data (figure \ref{HER_Sherman},) the Sherman function is
$S \approx{} -0.23$.

The full data set consists of twenty-four graphs like the two shown,
representing three incident beam currents, at each of eight film
thicknesses.  Readers who would prefer to see the full data set,

Having presented the data in raw form, it is time to analyse and

inspection of the data, and estimates of the Mott asymmetries (and
therefore of the reflected beam spin polarizations) obtained in the
experiments.

\section{Visual Inspection of the Data}
\label{visual}

For any given film thickness, incident beam current, and channeltron,
I find that the most salient visual feature of the data (chapter
\ref{results}) is the sign of the gradient of each electron arrival
rate against beam energy curve: the electron arrival rate decreases
with increasing energy.  The second most salient feature is the sign
of the curvature of each curve: the graph is convex $\cup$.  This
shape is as one would expect from equation \ref{reflected-intensity},
which is derived from the new theory in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}.

The third most salient visual feature of the data is the direction,
in which the electron arrival rate, for the majority of beam energies,
changes on moving from magnetization up to magnetization
down\footnote{This, of course, may be a move either forward or
  backward in time}.  My visual estimates of this direction are
presented in table \ref{movement-directions}.

\caption{Visually Estimated Directions, in Which the Electron Arrival
  Rates Change on Moving from Magnetization up to Magnetization down}
\label{movement-directions}
\end{table}

This distribution of changes in electron arrival rate is interesting,
because, from the new theory in chapter \ref{theoretical-context}, and
indeed from any theory, in which the process of changing the
magnetization direction affects the arrival rates at the channeltrons
only through the reflected electron beam's spin polarization, one
would expect the changes in the two channeltrons' arrival rates, on
reversing the magnetization direction, to be opposite.  This has
(table \ref{movement-directions}) been the case in only one of the
twenty-four sets of conditions of film thickness and beam current
measured.

It is suggested that, in terms of the diagrammatic view of the
scientific method presented in ``Bayesian Interpolation''
\cite{MacKay:1992:BI}, and in ``Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models''
\cite{MacKay:1992:BMA}, this section, unlike the rest of this chapter,
belongs to the `decide whether to create new models,' stage, rather
than to the `assign preferences to the alternative models' stage
\footnote{Visual impressions have \cite{James:2003:ETD} also been used
  in this way in atmospheric science.}.  Only some qualitative
pointers to theories that \emph{might} better match the contents of
table \ref{movement-directions} will be provided; the construction of
enough quantitative detail to permit testing of new theories, in the
light of data, will be left as an exercise for any reader who wishes
to undertake it.

The author suggests three possible forms for new theories, in the
light of table \ref{movement-directions}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The precision of the positioning of the sample may be
  insufficient to prevent variation, of the kind observed in section
  \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, in the acceptance probability at the
  front of the polarimeter (the $a$ of appendix
  \ref{adaptive-models}.)  In support of this explanation, it is noted
  that, since the position of the sample is only reset on changes of
  magnetization or of film thickness, one would expect, if it were the
  correct explanation, that the direction of change of the count rate
  would be independent of channeltron number and beam current,
  depending only on film thickness, as is (table
  \ref{movement-directions}) indeed observed in almost all cases.
  However, there are two strong arguments against this explanation.
  Firstly, the precision with which the sample was positioned was
  chosen on the basis of empirical evidence (section
  \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}) about the precision needed to prevent
  this effect.  Secondly, the overall proportions of ``up'' and
  ``down'' directions of change of electron arrival rate, on
  magnetization reversal, are (table \ref{movement-directions})
  unequal, by an amount that, depending on the details of the
  explanation, may be statistically significant, and militate against
  any explanation that does not involve a true magnetic effect.
\item{}The experiment may not be performed quickly enough to prevent
  drift effects, of the kind observed in section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments} between the measurements for different
  magnetization directions on the same film thickness\footnote{Drift
  effects on the longer time-scale between measurements on different
  film thicknesses would not produce the effect that needs to be
  explained, and are modelled within appendix \ref{adaptive-models}.},
  or the drift effects may be related to switching on and off the
  channeltron, rather than to a particular time-scale.  In support of
  this explanation, it is noted that, as long as the drift effects
  relate to switching on and off the channeltrons, which occurs only
  at changes of magnetization direction or film thickness, one would
  expect, if it were the correct explanation, that the direction of
  change of the count rate would be independent of channeltron number
  and beam current, depending only on film thickness, as is (table
  \ref{movement-directions}) indeed observed in almost all cases.
  However, there are three strong arguments against this explanation.
  Firstly, the speed, with which the experiments were performed, was
  chosen on the basis of empirical evidence (section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments}) about the speed needed to prevent drift
  effects; of course, this argument does not apply, if the drift
  effects relate to switching on and off the channeltrons, rather than
  to a particular time-scale.  Secondly, the overall proportions of
  ``up'' and ``down'' directions of change of electron arrival rate,
  on magnetization reversal, are (table \ref{movement-directions})
  unequal, by an amount that, depending on the details of the
  explanation, may be statistically significant, and militate against
  any explanation that does not involve a true magnetic effect.
  Thirdly, if this explanation is correct, and the drift effects
  relate to a particular time-scale, rather than to switching on and
  off the channeltrons, then, given that the time-scale for changing
  channeltrons is only a factor of $\sim{}2$ shorter than that for
  reversing magnetization direction, one would not expect the observed
  (table \ref{movement-directions}) high degree of independence of
  channeltron number, in the direction of change of the electron
  arrival rate.
\item{}A stray magnetic field, either from the sample itself, or from
  some ferromagnetic part of the sample holder (figure \ref{holder},)
  may be deflecting the electron beam in such a way as to change the
  acceptance probability at the front of the polarimeter (the $a$ of
  appendix \ref{adaptive-models}.)  In support of this explanation, it
  is noted that one would expect, if it were the correct explanation:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}that the direction of change of the count rate would be
  independent of channeltron number and beam current, depending only
  on film thickness, as is (table \ref{movement-directions}) indeed
  observed in almost all cases, and
\item{}in contrast to any effects that are not genuinely magnetic,
  that the overall proportions of ``up'' and ``down'' directions of
  change of electron arrival rate, on magnetization reversal, would be
  unequal, as they are (table \ref{movement-directions},) by an amount
  that, depending on the details of the explanation, may be
  statistically significant.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

If more quantitative theories are constructed, based on the first two
explanations, they would be expected to have significantly more
adjustable parameters than the models in appendix
\ref{adaptive-models}, and therefore to take a prohibitive amount of
CPU time to fit to the data using a Monte Carlo method.  With
reluctance, because it would have the consequence of ignoring
evidence, which is relevant to a problem of parameter estimation and
model comparison under consideration, long-term\footnote{The author
has made some comments elsewhere \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} on how this
situation arises.}, it might, therefore, be necessary to set aside the
existing experimental results (chapter \ref{results},) and instead
assess the existing models (chapter \ref{theoretical-context},
appendix \ref{adaptive-models},) in the light of future experimental
results, with the experimental method adapted to position the sample
more precisely, to be quicker, or to avoid switching on and off the
channeltrons.

However, if more quantitative theories are constructed, based on the,
apparently more plausible, third explanation, they will provide an
exciting possibility for using electron beams to probe magnetic
surfaces, without relying on spin polarization effects.  The data in
chapter \ref{results} would be immediately suitable for use in this
process, but future experimental data could be gathered without the
practical difficulties involved in Mott polarimetry.  If, despite
this, demand for measurements of the spin polarization of reflected
beams continues to exist, it may be worthwhile to know that Lind
\cite{Lind:1987:SSG} discovered that the stray field around a sample
could be substantially reduced, by briefly applying a magnetic field,
smaller than that used to magnetize the sample and in the opposite
direction, after the sample was magnetized.

It is also, of course, possible that the future of magnetism
measurements with electron beams will take a course that the author
has not foreseen; either one for which the measurements in chapter
\ref{results} are useful, or one for which they are not useful.

In passing, it is noted that although the author is familiar with
several examples (section \ref{experimental-context})
\cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP,
  Kirschner:1985:IES, Landolt:1985:SPS, Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG,
  Lind:1987:SSA, Weber:1999:EAF} of published data, obtained using
Mott polarimeters, on the spin polarization of reflected, diffracted,
transmitted, inelastic, and secondary electron beams from magnetic and
non-magnetic materials, these all present the data in a processed
form, similar to that of section \ref{traditional-estimation-section},
rather than in the raw form of chapter \ref{results}.  This is
understandable, given the length constraints of papers in collections,
journal articles, and theses, but regrettably, renders it impossible
to apply reasoning of the kind above to these data.

Although the primary purpose of this section was to make qualitative
suggestions, it will probably be useful to make a quantitative estimate
of the deflection that a stray magnetic field produces, in a reflected
electron beam (figure \ref{circles},) as a check on the plausibility
of this suggestion.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{circles}}
\htmladdimg{./circles.png}
\caption{Deflection of an Electron Beam by a Stray Magnetic Field}
\label{circles}
\end{figure}

The classical equations of motion of an electron, in a stray magnetic flux
density, in the $z$ direction, $B$, are
\begin{equation}
\frac{\td{^2x}}{\td{t}^2} = \frac{eB}{m}\frac{\td{y}}{\td{t}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\td{^2y}}{\td{t}^2} = -\frac{eB}{m}\frac{\td{x}}{\td{t}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time, $-e$ is the charge on an electron, and $m$ is
the mass of an electron.

The general solutions of these equations of motion are
\begin{equation}
x =
-\frac{imC}{eB}\exp\left(\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+\frac{imD}{eB}\exp\left(-\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+F\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
y =
\frac{mC}{eB}\exp\left(\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+\frac{mD}{eB}\exp\left(-\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+H\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $C$, $D$, $F$, and $H$ are arbitrary constants.  Given the
boundary conditions, for the incident beam, that, at $t = 0$, $(x,y) =
(-a,a)$ and $\left(\frac{\td{x}}{\td{t}},\frac{\td{y}}{\td{t}}\right)
= (u,-u)$, the arbitrary constants can be set, to give
\begin{equation}
x =
\frac{mu}{eB}\left(\cos\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)+\sin\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)-1\right)-a\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
y =
\frac{mu}{eB}\left(\cos\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)-\sin\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)-1\right)+a\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Only the electron trajectory, not the behaviour in time, is of
interest.  Therefore, it would be useful to find a time-independent
function of $x$ and $y$.  Using the advance knowledge that the
trajectory would be a circle, it was decided to seek such a function
of the form $(x-X)^2+(y-Y)^2$.  The incident electron trajectory was
thus discovered to be, where $\mu{}(B) = \frac{mu}{eB}$,
\begin{equation}
(x+\mu{}(B)+a)^2+(y+\mu{}(B)-a)^2 = 2(\mu(B))^2\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
a circle, of radius $\sqrt{2}\mu(B)$, centred on
$(-\mu{}(B)-a,-\mu{}(B)+a)$.  The $x$ co-ordinate at which the
reflection takes place, i.e.~of the intersection of this circle and
the sample surface, is
\begin{equation}
b(B) = -\mu{}(B)-a\pm\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2+2\mu{}(B)a-a^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Of the two intersections, the one of interest is that closest to the
starting point $(-a,a)$.  Therefore, where $\mu{}(B) < 0$,
\begin{equation}
b(B) = -\mu{}(B)-a-\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2+2\mu{}(B)a-a^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and where $\mu{}(B) > 0$,
\begin{equation}
b(B) = -\mu{}(B)-a+\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2+2\mu{}(B)a-a^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The reflected electron trajectory will also be a circle of radius
$\sqrt{2}\mu{}(B)$.  However, the centre will be geometrically
reflected, in the plane $x = b(B)$, to
$(\mu{}(B)+a+2b(B),-\mu{}(B)+a)$, i.e.~the trajectory is
\begin{equation}
(x-\mu{}(B)-a-2b(B))^2+(y+\mu{}(B)-a)^2 = 2(\mu{}(B))^2\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

On the assumption that $a' = a$, this trajectory strikes the
polarimeter front at an $x$ co-ordinate
\begin{equation}
c(B) = \mu{}(B)+a+b(B)\pm\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2-(b(B))^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The intersection of interest is the one closest to the starting point
$(b(B),0)$, i.e.~where $\mu{}(B) < -a$,
\begin{equation}
c(B) = \mu{}(B)+a+b(B)+\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2-(b(B))^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and where $\mu{}(B) > -a$,
\begin{equation}
c(B) = \mu{}(B)+a+b(B)-\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2-(b(B))^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The distance that the reflected electron beam is displaced, along the
polarimeter front, on reversing the stray field, is
\begin{equation}
d(B) = \sqrt{2}(c(B)-c(-B))\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This distance is plotted against the stray magnetic flux density in
figure \ref{plausible}, using the estimated $a = 100\ut{mm}$, and a
value of $u$ based on an estimated electron kinetic energy of
$750\ut{eV}$.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\input{plausible}}
\htmladdimg{./plausible.png}
\caption{The Distance along the Polarimeter Front that the Reflected
  Electron Beam Is Displaced, on Reversing the Stray Magnetic Field,
  against Stray Magnetic Flux Density}
\label{plausible}
\end{figure}
The width of the electron beam is of the order of $1\ut{mm}$, and the
width of the polarimeter opening is of order $2\ut{mm}$.  Therefore,
any displacement of $\sim{}100\ut{\mu{}m}$ or more will have a
significant effect on the acceptance probability.  It is clear, from
the graph, that a displacement of this size can be obtained with a
realistic flux density.

\section[Traditional Estimation]{Traditional Estimation of the Mott
  Asymmetries}
\label{traditional-estimation-section}

Other workers \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP} have considered,
in a non-Bayesian framework, the possibility of the two electron
detectors in a Mott polarimeter having different detection
efficiencies $\eta_i$, either due to intrinsic properties of the
detectors, or due to a misalignment of the heavy-metal foil that
perturbed the scattering probabilities at the two detectors, and
devised the following estimator of the product $SP$ of Sherman
function and beam polarization, in the presence of such a
multiplicative systematic error:
\begin{equation}
\label{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}
SP = \frac{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}-\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}+\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This estimator relies on the electron arrival rates $f_{i,j}$, at
detectors $j = 1$ and $j = 2$, being measured for beams which, on
entering the polarimeter, are of the same intensity, and of
polarizations that have equal magnitudes, and opposite signs $i =
\pm$.  These conditions are met, in the experiments currently being
reported, as long as the only effect, on the reflected electron beam,
of reversing the sample magnetization is to reverse the beam
polarization.  In particular, this requires that the spin-orbit
interaction at the sample is negligible, as indeed it is, since the
kinetic energies of the electrons are much less than their rest mass
energy.  Note that equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator} is a
repeat, in slightly different notation, of equation \ref{rev}, and is
derived and explained in section \ref{explain}.

In this section, the results will be interpreted using equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, as an alternative to the
Bayesian inference process described in appendix
\ref{adaptive-models}.  Note that the estimator could be re-derived,
as the expectation value of $SP$ in a Bayesian model with appropriate
assumptions.  This would have the advantage of allowing these
assumptions, which would be made explicit by the Bayesian approach, to
be examined for reasonableness, and changed if necessary (see also
\emph{Some Philosophical Implications of Bayesian Statistics}
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.)  Unfortunately, the model would be a model
\emph{of} the reflected beam, not of the sample, and therefore
successful estimation of its parameters does not further the aim of
determining characteristics of the sample.

The procedure used here will be to divide the data set into subsets;
the members of any given subset will be all the measurements of
electron arrival rate taken under one particular set of conditions of
film thickness, incident beam energy, incident beam current, and data
acquisition apparatus dwell time.  By the design of the experiments,
each of these subsets will contain four measurements, of the correct
mutual relationship to be used as the $f_{i,j}$ in equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}.  This will provide three or
four asymmetry values for each combination of film thickness and beam
energy; the arithmetic mean of these is taken for presentation.  The
results of this procedure are shown in figure
\ref{grand_asyms}.

From a visual inspection of published calibration data (figure
\ref{HER_Sherman},) the Sherman function is $S \approx{} -0.23$; this
is expected to be independent of the beam energy, because the voltages
on electrodes in the polarimeter were adjusted with beam energy to
maintain a constant electron kinetic energy when the electrons arrived
at the thorium foil.  Similarly, it is expected to be independent of
film thickness, because the cobalt film whose thickness is varied is
not the thorium foil, part of the measuring apparatus, at which the
Mott scattering effect takes place; the thickness of the latter is
constant.

This estimator is clearly indicating non-zero asymmetries in most
cases, indicating that, despite the above-described systematic error
due to the stray field from the sample or its holder (section
\ref{visual},) the experiments have successfully detected the cobalt's
Weiss field.  This is comforting, given that a Bayesian statistical
analysis (section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff},) which the author
believes to be more rigorous than the use of the estimator in equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, will indicate (section
\ref{further-conclusions}) very decisively that the experiments have
detected the cobalt ferro-magnetism.

According to the new, classical-field theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, the reflected beam polarization is expected
to be independent of beam energy, because the theory is a zeroth order
Taylor expansion in the inverse beam energy, the films are all thick
enough that Fabry-Perot reflections from the $Co/Cu$ interface, which
would otherwise introduce an oscillatory energy dependence, are lost
to inelastic scattering, and the energies in the experiments were high
enough to be within the expected domain of validity of this Taylor
expansion.  Given the unfortunate absence of alternative theories,
directly applicable to $Co/Cu(001)$ films, hinting at the conceivable
form of a systematic energy-dependence in the polarization, it is
impossible to comment valuably on whether the data support the
hypothesis of energy-independence; it is, however, possible to comment
that the generally non-zero measured polarization values appear to
militate against versions of the theory in which the Weiss field
affecting the probing electrons, and the resulting energy-independent
polarization, are zero.

According to the new, classical-field theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, the reflected beam polarization is expected
to depend on the film thickness only through the dependence of the
electrostatic potential and Weiss field in the sample on film
thickness.  The only clear pointer available to the form of this
dependence is the non-ferro-magnetic nature of bulk copper, which
would lead one to expect a zero polarization from the zero-thickness
film.  Intriguingly, the measured polarizations from the
zero-thickness film appear to depart from zero.  It is not clear
whether this is indicative of some localized magnetization at the
surface of the copper, or of a systematic error in the measured
results, such as that, discussed in a footnote above, which may be
introduced by the use of a non-linear, and therefore potentially
biased, polarization estimator, as will be discussed below (section
\ref{why-stat}.)

The size of the estimated reflected beam polarization is typically of
the order of $0.1$.  This is the same order of magnitude as most of
the published measured and theoretical reflected beam polarizations at
high beam energies, reviewed in chapter \ref{theoretical-context}.

Having used this simple estimator to analyse the data, the author will
now implement a more sophisticated, Bayesian method for parameter
estimation and model comparison.

\section[Further Discussion and Conclusions]{Further Discussion of,
and Conclusions from, the Experimental Results}
\label{relegated-bayesian-stuff}

Above, several references have been made to a Bayesian inference
process, for drawing conclusions about sample characteristics from the
experimental results.  In this section, that Bayesian inference
process is presented.  First, an explanation will be given of why the
author believes undertaking this more sophisticated inference process
to be desirable.

\subsection{Why Is This Statistical Analysis Necessary?}

The author is the first to acknowledge the benefits of having as
little complicated mathematics as possible between raw experimental
results and conclusions, in terms of the ability of complicated
calculations to conceal mistakes.  Therefore, some justification seems
to be required for the intervention of a sophisticated statistical
algorithm.  The justification will have two parts: the first will
explain why any statistical inference process is needed at all, and
the second will explain why a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
was coded, rather than using computer codes already in the public
domain.

\subsubsection{Why Use Any Statistical Inference?}
\label{why-stat}

The community of researchers using measurements of the spin
polarization of electron beams has long had available the estimator in
equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, for obtaining the spin
polarization of an electron beam, from the measured electron arrival
rates at a Mott polarimeter's two detectors; this estimator eliminates
systematic errors due to misalignment of the electron beam entering
the polarimeter, and due to unequal sensitivities of the two
detectors.  By a happy coincidence, the systematic error that may be
introduced by a stray field, which reverses with the sample
magnetization, is also multiplicative, and is, therefore, also
eliminated by this polarization estimator.

It was established, following a published derivation
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP}, in section \ref{explain} that, in the absence of
random errors, the estimator is equal to the true polarization.  Why,
therefore, cannot the estimator, along with published values of the
Sherman function $S$, be used to calculate the reflected beam
polarization, and then equations \ref{polarization} and
\ref{reflected-intensity} inverted to give the electro-magnetic
characteristics of the sample, avoiding any need for a statistical
process?

A footnote to section \ref{specific} alludes to the answer, which lies
in the seemingly innocuous phrase ``in the absence of random errors.''
Real experiments are characterized by the presence, not the absence,
of random errors, in particular, in this case, in the measured
electron arrival rates.  When there are random errors, the electron
arrival rate $f_{i,j}$, for given true values of the intensity and
polarization of the beam entering the polarimeter, $G_{\textrm{true}}$
and $P_{\textrm{true}}$, is characterized\footnote{This is not one of
the items of controversy between Bayesian and frequentist
statisticians, and is a proposition that statisticians from both camps
would accept.} by a probability density distribution
$P(f_{i,j}|G_{\textrm{true}},P_{\textrm{true}})$.  On the
four-dimensional space of the $f_{i,j}$, one can define both the joint
probability density
$\prod_{i,j}P(f_{i,j}|G_{\textrm{true}},P_{\textrm{true}})$, and the
polarization estimator $P_{\textrm{formula}}(\vc{f}) =
\frac{\sqrt{f_{1,+}f_{2,-}}-\sqrt{f_{1,-}f_{2,+}}}{\sqrt{f_{1,+}f_{2,-}}+\sqrt{f_{1,-}f_{2,+}}}$.
One can then, in principle, obtain the expectation value
$\int_{\textrm{All
space}}P_{\textrm{formula}}(\vc{f})\prod_{i,j}P(f_{i,j}|G_{\textrm{true}},P_{\textrm{true}})\td{f_{i,j}}$
of the estimator, given $G_{\textrm{true}}$ and $P_{\textrm{true}}$.
If this expectation value is equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$, the
estimator is unbiased.  If, on the other hand, the expectation value
is not equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$, it is a biased estimator; in
other words, despite its success in eliminating systematic errors due
to certain physical conditions, the estimator has created a new
systematic error of its own, out of the random errors in the electron
arrival rate measurements; this is the systematic error which, it was
suggested above, may have been responsible for the non-zero
polarization estimates obtained from bare copper.

Unfortunately, because the estimator is non-linear in the raw
measurements, it is very likely that its expectation value will not be
equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$, and that such an artificial systematic
error will arise.  Worse still, evaluating the integral, to quantify
the size of this systematic error (and possibly correct it,) is beyond
the author's analytical capabilities; it could be integrated
numerically, but this would sacrifice the advantage of mathematical
simplicity, which was the motivation for examining this estimator.
This is what justifies turning to statistical inference.

\subsubsection{Why Write New Software for the Statistical Inference?}

Having made the case for using a statistical process to obtain
information, there remains a need to explain why the results were
analysed using a new program, written by the author of this thesis,
implementing a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, rather than using
computer codes already in the public domain.  Computer codes for
statistical inference already in the public domain (or at least, those
known to the author,) such as Gnuplot \cite{Crawford:1998:G} and
Origin \cite{::GSM}, typically perform both model comparison and
parameter estimation based on the $\chi^2$ statistic for the badness
of fit of a model to the data,
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_i\left(\frac{(x_i-y_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $i$ indexes the experimental conditions where some measurements
have been made, $x_i$ is the measured value obtained in conditions
$i$, $y_i$ is the value predicted by the model in conditions $i$, and
$\sigma_i$ is the quoted random error on measurement $x_i$.  $y_i$,
and sometimes $\sigma_i$, depend on the values chosen for the model's
adjustable parameters, and on which of the distinct, discrete models
available is being considered; hence, the badness of fit $\chi^2$ also
depends on these influences.  The measure of goodness of fit used in
Bayesian statistics (and in some non-Bayesian methods) is
\cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP} the likelihood function $P(D|M,\vc{P})$, which
is the conditional probability density distribution over the space of
values of the set $D$ of measurements, given a model $M$ and a set of
model parameter values $\vc{P}$; the likelihood, like $\chi^2$,
depends on the models that are chosen.  On the common
\cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} assumption that this probability distribution,
as a function of any single measured value, is Gaussian in shape,
$\chi^2$ has a clear meaning in Bayesian statistics:
\begin{equation}
P(D|M,\vc{P}) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^N\pi^N\prod_i(\sigma_i^2)}}\exp{}\left(-\frac{\chi^2}{2}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
i.e.~$\chi^2$ is proportional to the logarithm of the likelihood.

The output given by the typical parameter estimation and model
comparison software already in the public domain consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The set $\vc{P}^*$ of values of a model's parameters that
  minimizes $\chi^2$ (equivalently, maximizes the likelihood,)
  providing an estimate of the parameter values in which it is
  reasonable to believe, given the experimental evidence; to find the
  minimum, the standard programs use the Marquadt-Levenberg algorithm,
  which is explained in \emph{Numerical Recipes}
  \cite{Press:1986:NRA},
\item{}the coefficients of a second-order Taylor expansion of the
  $\chi^2$ statistic in the parameters of a model, about $\vc{P}^*$,
  describing a parabolic approximation to $\chi^2$ (equivalently, a
  Gaussian approximation to the likelihood) in parameter space,
  providing an estimate of the uncertainty in the parameter estimates
  $\vc{P}^*$,
\item{}the maximum value $\chi^{2*}$ of the $\chi^2$ statistic, as a
  model's parameters are varied, providing an estimate of a model's
  badness of fit for model comparison purposes, and, in the case of
  Gnuplot,
\item{}a version of $\chi^{2*}$, adjusted by dividing it by the
  difference between the number of measurements and the number of
  adjustable model parameters, providing an alternative estimate of a
  model's badness of fit for model comparison purposes, which attempts
  to implement Occam's razor; the philosophical and statistical basis
  for implementing Occam's razor in this way is unclear.
\end{itemize}

The first reason for deciding against using codes of this form is that
output of a best-fit goodness of fit for model comparison leaves the
user with a problem of how to implement Occam's razor; Gnuplot's
adjusted $\chi^{2*}$ attempts to implement Occam's razor by penalizing
models for having many adjustable parameters.  However, if, like the
author, one believes that the purpose of Occam's razor is to prevent a
model from using information from experimental results to fine-tune
its parameters, then recycling the same information to act as evidence
for itself against other models, then using an Occam's razor based on
the number of adjustable parameters raises the possibility of unfairly
penalizing a model that, although it has many adjustable parameters,
does not fine-tune them very much on the basis of the experimental
data, i.e.~that is a good fit to the experimental results over a wide
range of parameter values.  As it will transpire, this is precisely
the situation encountered with the experiments and models central to
this thesis.  Bayesian methods implement \cite{MacKay:1992:BI,
MacKay:1992:BMA} Occam's razor automatically, by comparing models'
average likelihoods over all values of their parameters (known as
marginal likelihoods,) weighted according to the pre-experiment
plausibility function encoded in the prior probability distribution,
instead of comparing their maximum likelihoods; this directly
penalises \cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} models for
fine-tuning their parameters, not for merely having parameters to
fine-tune.

The author is not claiming that it would be impossible to implement a
fair Occam's razor using, for example, Gnuplot.  Indeed, since
completing the analysis of the data presented in this thesis, the
author has, in the course of a separate experimental project, devised
a formula for obtaining a marginal likelihood from the outputs of
Gnuplot.  However, some programming is required to implement this.

The second reason for deciding against using the established,
publicly available codes is that parameter estimation by a
least-squares method has a number of features, some of which tend to
render it unsuitable for use in the present project:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The assumption, needed to give $\chi^2$ a clear meaning in
  Bayesian (or any probabilistic) statistics, that the likelihood, as
  a function of the value of an individual experimental datum, for
  fixed model parameters, is a Gaussian, is reasonable, given that
  electron arrival at the detectors is expected to be a Poisson
  process, and that the numbers of electrons being counted are
  sufficiently large \cite{Boas:1983:MMP} for a Gaussian to be an
  extremely good approximation to a Poisson distribution; this
  assumption has not been challenged in the development of the
  author's Bayesian method, and will be discussed briefly below
  (section \ref{discussion-likelihood}.)
\item{}The assumption that the likelihood associated with the
  experimental data set as a whole, as a function of the adjustable
  parameters of a model, is well approximated by a Gaussian (the
  second order Taylor expansion of $\chi^2$,) cannot stand for this
  experiment and the new, classical-field model presented in chapter
  \ref{theoretical-context}.  This is because, when equation
  \ref{polarization}, which predicts the measurable reflected beam
  polarization $P$, as a function of the electrostatic potential $V$
  and Weiss field $B$ in the sample, is inverted to give the ratio
  $\frac{B}{V}$ (or $B$ or $V$ individually) as a function of $P$,
  $\frac{B}{V}$ is found not to be single-valued.  This means that the
  likelihood function has two peaks in parameter space; a Gaussian
  approximation can only hope to represent one of these peaks, and
  therefore will lose crucial information.  This difficulty is likely
  to be surmountable; one of the standard computer codes could perhaps
  be used with some function of $\frac{B}{V}$, which is a
  single-valued function of $P$, as a fitting parameter, instead of
  $B$ and $V$ separately, or $\frac{B}{V}$ itself.  Nevertheless, this
  introduces extra complication in configuring a standard fitting
  program, which slightly undermines the case in terms of simplicity
  for using a standard program.
\item{}The parabolic approximation to $\chi^2$, or Gaussian
  approximation to the likelihood, output by a least-squares
  algorithm, even, if the approximation holds, encodes only the
  goodness of fit of the model to the data as a function of the
  adjustable parameters.  In Bayesian statistics, this is only half
  the story of parameter estimation; to obtain a Bayesian ``belief
  function'' of the parameters, representing how strongly one believes
  in each conceivable set of parameter values, given the experimental
  results (this belief function is known as the posterior probability
  distribution,) the likelihood must be modulated by a plausibility
  function, or prior probability distribution, describing the level of
  credence one gives to each conceivable set of parameters before
  undertaking the experiment.  Using the output of the least-squares
  algorithm directly for parameter estimation would be equivalent to
  an implicit, fixed assumption that the prior probability
  distribution is uniform over parameter space.  Elsewhere
  \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, the author has expressed concern over the
  philosophical consequences of prior probability distributions being
  implicit and fixed.  Here, it is possible to be more pragmatic,
  simply noting that for many parameters, a uniform prior probability
  distribution is inappropriate: for example, the parameter might be a
  quantum efficiency, in which case it makes sense to give it a
  non-zero prior probability density for parameter values between zero
  and one, and a zero prior probability density outside this domain;
  alternatively, standard data tables might give an estimate and
  uncertainty for the parameter, based on previous experimental
  evidence, which could be well represented by a Gaussian prior
  probability distribution.  This problem is also likely to be
  surmountable: since completing the analysis of the data presented in
  this thesis, the author has, in the course of a separate
  experimental project, examined the possibility of transforming a
  parameter $a$, over which a prior probability distribution $P(a)$ is
  required, to a parameter $b$, which is a function of $a$, such that
  $P(a)\td{a} = \td{b}$, i.e.~the prior probability distribution over
  $b$ is uniform, and $b$ can be used as a fitting parameter in a
  least-squares algorithm; it transpires that, for the common forms of
  $P(a)$ that the author has examined to date, the differential
  equation has a ready analytical solution, providing a simple formula
  to transform between $a$ and $b$.  Nevertheless, this introduces
  extra complication in configuring a standard fitting program, which
  slightly undermines the case in terms of simplicity for using a
  standard program.
\end{itemize}

To summarize, there are certain obstacles to the use of computer codes
already in the public domain to undertake a valid analysis of the
experimental data presented in this project.  Although methods of
working around these obstacles could be devised, these methods entail
some mathematical and computational complication, and therefore
compromise the advantage of simplicity that would be the motivation
for choosing existing computer codes.  Therefore, the author has, for
the purposes of this project, chosen instead to use a fundamentally
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for parameter estimation and
model comparison, and to code this method anew, in the high-level
programming language Perl; the choice of such a high-level language
may recover some of the simplicity lost by choosing to write new code.

Having explained why the inference method has been chosen, it is time
to undertake parameter estimation and model comparison according to
that method.

\subsection{Statistical Inference Process}
\label{adaptive-models}

In this section, the data presented in chapter \ref{results} will be
used to estimate the values of the adjustable parameters in two models
of the system of samples and measuring apparatus, and to compare the
two models.  The framework used for this data interpretation will be
Bayesian inference \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP, Howson:1989:SRB,
MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA, MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI}.
The finer mathematical details of the inference method, including the
prior probability distributions and likelihood functions, and a
description of the numerical method used for the calculations, will be
presented in section \ref{inference-method-details}.

\subsubsection{Framework of the Models}
\label{framework}

Both models are based on the new theory of polarized electron
reflection from a bulk sample presented in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}.  The use of a model intended for a bulk
sample is justified on the basis that the inelastic mean free path of
electrons, of the energies used in this experiment, is
\cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF} no more than $\sim{}1\ut{nm}$,
with the result that even rather thin films will appear, when examined
with an electron beam, to be bulk materials.

Therefore, when the beam current into the electron gun is $F$, the
rate of electron incidence on the sample is $F/e$, and the rate of
electrons leaving the sample, in the reflected beam (figure \ref{sd},)
is, from integration of equation \ref{reflected-amplitude},
\begin{equation}
G = \left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The polarization of the reflected beam is, from equation
\ref{polarization},
\begin{equation}
P = -\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The electrostatic potential, $V$, and the magnetic flux density, $B$,
in the sample, are adjustable parameters of the ``main'' model, while
in the ``null'' model, only $V$ is adjustable, $B$ being fixed at
zero.  In fact, since there are eight cobalt film thicknesses,
including zero thickness (table \ref{recorded-growth-conditions},)
there are multiple parameters of this type, $V_j$ and $B_j$, with the
film thicknesses indexed by integers $j$, from $0$ to $7$ inclusive;
for thickness $0$, $B_0$ is fixed at zero even for the ``main'' model.
These then lead to electron leaving rates $G_j$ and reflected
polarizations $P_j$.

Since the entrance hole of the polarimeter (figure \ref{sd}) is of
finite width, it is possible that not all of the electrons in the
reflected beam will enter the polarimeter.  Therefore, an acceptance
probability $a$ is defined, so that the rate of electrons entering the
polarimeter is $aG_j$.  The entrance hole and grids are assumed to be
non-polarizing, with the result that the polarization of the beam
entering the polarimeter is $P_j$.

The thorium foil then scatters electrons towards the two channeltrons.
The rate of electron arrival at channeltron $1$ will be, by equation
\ref{r1},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(1, j)} = \Gamma{}(1+SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and that at channeltron $2$ will be, by equation \ref{r2},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(2, j)} = \Gamma{}(1-SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where the spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma$ and the
Sherman function $S$ are characteristics of the thorium foil.
Calibration values of $\Gamma$ and $S$ for a Mott polarimeter, of
identical design to that used for these experiments, have been
provided by other workers \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}, and those for
electrons with energy $20\ut{keV}$ are reproduced in figures
\ref{HER_Average} and \ref{HER_Sherman}.  Although the energy of the
electrons on striking the thorium foil, in the experiments presented
in this thesis, is $(20.5\pm{}0.00725)\ut{keV}$, not $20\ut{keV}$, the
systematic error introduced by this energy difference
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} is negligible, compared with the quantization
error of the author's readings from the published graphs (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood}.)

\caption{Graph of spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma$ against energy
  loss window $W$, from the calibration data for the compact

  deviations associated with the quantization of the author's readings
  from the published graph.}

  quadrature of the standard deviation associated with the
  quantization of the author's readings from the published graph, and
  the error quoted on the published graph.}
\label{HER_Sherman}
\end{figure}

The published calibration data are for electron energies, on striking
the thorium foil, of $20\ut{keV}$ and $25\ut{keV}$, and are presented
as a function of the energy loss window $W$, defined by the potential
at the retarding grids (chapter \ref{compact}.)  The author has chosen
to include the published data for a $20\ut{keV}$ energy, on striking
the thorium foil, in the data set (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood},) from which inference is to proceed, and
to characterize the thorium foil by by twelve adjustable parameters,
$\Gamma_k$ and $S_k$, where $k$ runs through integers from $0$ to $5$
inclusive,
\begin{equation}
\label{Gammamodel}
\Gamma = \sum_{k=0}^5\Gamma_kW^k\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{Smodel}
S = \sum_{k=0}^5S_kW^k\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

These fifth order Taylor expansions are an extension, to calibration
data that include relatively large energy loss windows, of the spirit
of the first and second order Taylor expansions in ``Use of thorium as
a target in electron-spin analyzers'' \cite{McClelland:1989:UTT}.  The
fifth order has been chosen to provide a number of adjustable
parameters, in each Taylor expansion, that is the largest integer less
than or equal to half the number of calibration data points, in line
with MacKay's \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} recommendation
for the number of parameters in neural network models.

Channeltron $i$ (figure \ref{channeltron},) used in single-electron
counting mode in these experiments, has a detection efficiency
$\eta_i$, adjusted by a time-dependent perturbation $p_{ij}$ to allow
for drift (section \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)  Since the speed of
the present experiments has been chosen so that the drift should not
be significant within the time-scale of measurements on a single film
thickness, each channeltron has just one $p_{ij}$ value for each film
thickness; the subscript $j$, as before, indexes the film thickness.
Therefore, the electron detection rate at the channeltron $i$, from
film thickness $j$, is predicted to be
\begin{equation}
\label{predicted-detection-rate}
f_p^{(i, j)} = p_{ij}\eta_if_a^{(i, j)}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The $p_{ij}$ and $\eta_i$ values are further adjustable parameters of
the model.

\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{further-conclusions}

This section describes the conclusions, obtained from the Bayesian
inference process, about the parameters in the two models, and about
which model is correct.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The electrostatic potential in the sample, as a function of
  cobalt thickness, in the null model, is as shown in figure
  \ref{estatpotnull}.

  $(78\pm{}11)\ut{\mu{}m}\ut{A}^{-1}\ut{s}^{-1}$.}
\label{magfluxmain}
\end{figure}
\item{}The posterior probability of the null model, in which cobalt
  ferro-magnetism is not detected, is estimated at
  \input{null-posterior}, and that of the main model, in which cobalt
  ferro-magnetism is detected, at \input{main-posterior}.
\end{enumerate}

At first glance, the precision of the inferred electrostatic
potentials and magnetic flux densities appears a rather unimpressive
return on the experimental effort involved in obtaining the
measurements.  In addition, a comparison (tables \ref{null-compare},
\ref{main-compare}) of the beliefs held about all of the parameters,
including those concerned with instrumental calibration and with
transient instrumental characteristics, before and after the data in
chapter \ref{results}, along with the published calibration data
(figures \ref{HER_Average}, \ref{HER_Sherman},) have been taken into
account, shows a broadening, rather than the narrowing that one might
expect, of the probability distribution over the parameter set, due to
the data.

However, the very decisive choice of model with successful detection
of the Weiss field as the better model supplies a greater reward.

\subsection{The Details of the Inference Method}
\label{inference-method-details}
\subsubsection{Standard Probability Distributions}

In this process, definitions of some standard probability density
distributions will be useful.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The Dirac delta function is such that
\begin{equation}
\delta{}(x) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for $x \neq{} 0$, and
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}\delta{}(x)\td{x} = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for any $\epsilon > 0$.  This probability distribution expresses the
certainty that $x = 0$.
\item{}The Gaussian probability distribution is
\begin{equation}
G(x; \mu{}, \sigma{}) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{}\left(-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This probability distribution is a standard default, much beloved
\cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} of the physics community, for
the distribution over a parameter $x$, knowledge of which can be
summarized by an expected value $\mu$ and a degree of variation
$\sigma$ about the expected value.
\item{}A perfect top-hat function is
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = \frac{1}{h-l}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
otherwise.  This probability distribution expresses the certainty that
a parameter $x$ lies between $l$ and $h$, and has equal probability of
lying in any fixed-width subset of that domain.  It is useful, for
example, where $x$ is a probability, and therefore must lie between
$0$ and $1$, or where $x$ is a measurement, quantized in units $h-l$
with an unknown origin by a digital meter, of a parameter
$\frac{h+l}{2}$.  In the rest of this section, an adapted version of
the perfect top-hat
\begin{equation}
T(x; l, h)\frac{127}{128(h-l)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
\begin{equation}
T(x; l, h) = G\left(x; \frac{h+l}{2}, \frac{h-l}{5.32}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
otherwise, is used.  This distribution has a probability
$\frac{127}{128}$ of being in the top-hat region, and a probability
density outside this region equal to a Gaussian of appropriate width
\cite{Manura:2002:M, ::ESH} for the probability integrated over this
region to be $\frac{1}{128}$.  Not only is this a more realistic
belief density than a perfect top-hat, it provides a probability
density gradient outside the top-hat region, which will help the
leapfrog proposal density (section \ref{monte-carlo}) to reduce the
random walk behaviour of the metropolis method.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Prior Probability Distributions}
\label{discussion-prior}

Bayesian estimation of the parameters in a model, on the basis of
experimental data, requires \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP, MacKay:1992:BI,
MacKay:1992:BMA} the explicit statement of prior probability
distributions, representing the beliefs that are held about the
parameters, before the experimental data are examined.  The author has
made some remarks about the importance of this requirement elsewhere
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.  The prior probability distributions for this
problem are presented in tables \ref{priortable} and
\ref{priortable2}.

\end{sidewaystable}

Justifications for these prior probability distributions follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}For the acceptance probability $a$, a uniform distribution over
  the range from $0$ to $1$ seems sensible, given that we know very
  little about the properties of this system, other than that the
  energy loss window at the front of the polarimeter is (table
  \ref{polarimeter-voltages}) held constant throughout the
  experiments.
\item{}The author and collaborators performed (section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments}) experiments, before those described
  here, which provided a rough estimate of the extent of the drift in
  the channeltron detection efficiencies.  The magnitude of the drift
  was found to be $\sim{}10\%$ peak-to-peak, on a typical time-scale
  of the order of a few hours.  The time-scale is represented in the
  division of the data set into chronologically contiguous subsets,
  which, by the design of the present experiment, coincide with single
  film thicknesses, and the magnitude in the standard deviation of the
  prior probability distributions over the time-dependent
  perturbations $p_{ij}$.
\item{}The scattering probability $\Gamma$ at the thorium foil must be
  in the range between zero and one, leading to the top-hat form for
  the distribution over $\Gamma_0$.
\item{} In the distributions over $\Gamma_k$, $k > 0$, the typical
  range of variation of the scattering probability over the energy
  scale of the experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor
  expansion, is asserted to be one.
\item{}The Sherman function $S$ at the thorium foil must be in the
  range between $-1$ and one, leading to the top-hat form for the
  distribution over $S_0$.
\item{}In the distributions over $S_k$, $k > 0$, the typical range of
  variation of the Sherman function over the energy scale of the
  experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor expansion, is
  asserted to be two.
\item{}Because the front ends of the channeltrons are earthed, the
  electrons reach them with the same kinetic energy that they have at
  the sample.  This means that the energies of the electrons, on
  arrival at the channeltrons, will range from $250\ut{eV}$ to
  $1500\ut{eV}$.  The detection efficiencies of channeltrons of the
  type used, in this energy range, are \cite{::CEM} between $0.78$ and
  $0.89$.  Therefore, a top-hat probability distribution, with these
  as its limits, is used for $\eta_i$.  The author does not believe
  that it is worthwhile to create an energy-dependent model, since the
  uncertainty in the efficiency, at a particular energy, is
  \cite{Bordoni:1971:CEM, ::CEM} comparable with its variation with
  energy, over this range.
\item{}It can be assumed that, in as much as the sample is believed to
  be bulk, the bulk material in question is, for $j > 0$, cobalt, or,
  for the clean sample $j = 0$, copper, because the meaning of
  ``bulk'' is ``topmost layer too thick for the electron beam to
  penetrate,'' i.e.  of a thickness that is large compared with
  $1\ut{nm}$ \cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF}.  Therefore, the
  electrostatic potential $V_j$ is expected to be the difference in
  expected work function between stainless steel, which is the
  material from which the front end of the electron gun, which sets
  the zero of potential for the electrons, is constructed, and copper
  for $j = 0$, or cobalt for other film thickness indices $j$.  The
  width of the distribution of $V_j$ can be estimated by combining in
  quadrature the random errors $\Delta\Phi_l = 0.05\Phi_l$
  \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} in measured work functions for the
  materials.  The work functions are $\Phi_{SS} = 4.1\ut{V}$ for
  stainless steel \cite{:2001:KPF}, $\Phi_{Cu} = 4.65\ut{V}$ for
  copper \cite{:2001:PTE}, and $\Phi_{Co} = 5\ut{V}$ for cobalt
  \cite{:2001:PTE}.
\item{}For the copper surface $j = 0$ in the main model, and for all
  film thickness indices $j$ in the null model, there are assumed to
  be no magnetic effects; the magnetic flux densities $B_j$ acting on
  the electrons, in these cases, are certainly zero.
\item{}The magnetic flux density $B_j$ that affects the electrons is
  expected to be the same effective field, originating in the exchange
  interaction \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE}, which creates
  ferro-magnetism.  For the samples with a cobalt surface, $j > 0$, in
  the main model, a prior expectation of zero will be used, with the
  width of the prior probability distribution, i.e. the typical size
  of the flux density, being given by the order-of-magnitude estimate
  $\frac{k_Bm_eT_c}{e\hbar}$ of the strength of this Weiss field that
  can \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} be obtained from the Curie temperature
  $T_C$.  This is the only difference between the null and main
  models.
\end{itemize}

The parameters are taken, a priori, to be independent.  Therefore, the
prior probability density of the parameter vector
\begin{eqnarray}
\vc{Q} & = & (Q_1,Q_2,\ldots{},Q_{47})\br
& = &
(a,p_{10},\ldots{},p_{17},p_{20},\ldots{},p_{27},\Gamma_0,\ldots{},\Gamma_5,S_0,\ldots{},S_5,\eta_1,\eta_2,\br
& & V_0,\ldots{},V_7,B_0,\ldots{},B_7)
\end{eqnarray}
is
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\vc{Q}|M_n) & = & \prod_{m=1}^{47}P(Q_m|M_n)\br
& = &
P(a|M_n)\left(\prod_{i=1}^2\prod_{j=0}^7P(p_{ij}|M_n)P(\eta_i|M_n)P(V_j|M_n)P(B_j|M_n)\right)\br
& & \times\left(\prod_{k=0}^5P(\Gamma_k|M_n)P(S_k|M_n)\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

There are also prior probabilities of each model, with any set of
parameter values.  These are taken to be
\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_N) & = & P(M_M)\br
& = & \frac{1}{2}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{The Likelihood}
\label{discussion-likelihood}

The data set $D$ is the disjunction of the set $D_0$ of results of the
present experiments (chapter \ref{results},) the set $D_{\Gamma}$ of
published $\Gamma$ calibration data (figure \ref{HER_Average},) and
the set $D_S$ of published $S$ calibration data (figure
\ref{HER_Sherman}.)

For each measured electron arrival rate $f_m^{(i, j)} \in{} D_0$, the
expectation of $f_m^{(i, j)}$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$,
is $f_p^{(i, j)}$ (equation \ref{predicted-detection-rate},)
calculated using parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, and the values of $E_b$
and $F$ pertaining to the data point in question.  There are two
known, significant sources of uncertainty in this prediction.  The
first results from the Poisson process \cite{Boas:1983:MMP} of
discrete electron arrivals at the channeltron, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}}$, where $256\tau$ is the time interval, over
which electrons are counted to obtain the arrival rate $f_m^{i, j}$.
The second results from the standard deviation uncertainty
$\Delta{}F$, in the incident beam current $F$, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\frac{f_p^{(i,
    j)}\Delta{}F}{F}$.  These are combined in quadrature to give an
overall standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i, j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}$.  The
likelihood function is then taken to be
\begin{equation}
P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q}) = G\left(f_m^{(i, j)}; f_p^{(i, j)},
  \sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i,
        j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_0|\vc{Q}) = \prod_{f_m^{(i, j)}\in{}D_0}P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma_E \in{}
D_{\Gamma}$, the expectation of $\Gamma_E$, with a given parameter
vector $\vc{Q}$, is $\Gamma$ (equation \ref{Gammamodel},) calculated
using the $\Gamma_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value of $W$ relevant to
$\Gamma_E$.  The uncertainty is introduced by the quantization, in
units of $q_{\Gamma} = 0.001$, of the author's readings from the
published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs.  This gives
\begin{equation}
P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q}) = T\left(\Gamma_E; \Gamma{}-\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2},
  \Gamma{}+\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_{\Gamma}|\vc{Q}) =
\prod_{\Gamma_E\in{}D_{\Gamma}}P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured Sherman function $S_E \in{} D_S$, the expectation of
$S_E$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, is $S$ (equation
\ref{Smodel},) calculated using the $S_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value
of $W$ relevant to $S_E$.  As well as the published
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} uncertainty $\Delta{}S_E$, uncertainty is
introduced by the quantization, in units of $q_S = 0.025$, of the
author's readings from the published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs:
the standard deviation associated with this is
$\frac{q_S}{\sqrt{12}}$.  These are combined in quadrature, to give a
standard deviation $\sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}$.  The
likelihood is then taken to be
\begin{equation}
P(S_E|\vc{Q}) = G\left(S_E; S,
  \sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_S|\vc{Q}) =
\prod_{S_E\in{}D_S}P(S_E|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For a given parameter vector, the three data sets are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D|\vc{Q}) = P(D_0|\vc{Q})P(D_{\Gamma}|\vc{Q})P(D_S|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Posterior Probability Distribution}
\label{discussion-posterior}

The posterior probability distribution over the parameters in the null
model (tables \ref{priortable}, \ref{priortable2}) $M_N$ is given by
Bayes' theorem \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP}:
\begin{equation}
P(\vc{Q}|D, M_N) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_N)}{P(D|M_N)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D|M_N) = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}P(\vc{Q}|M_N)P(D|\vc{Q})\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for the main model,
\begin{equation}
P(\vc{Q}|D, M_M) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_M)}{P(D|M_M)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D|M_M) = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}P(\vc{Q}|M_M)P(D|\vc{Q})\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The posterior probabilities of the models are
\begin{equation}
\label{null-posterior}
P(M_N|D) = \frac{P(D|M_N)P(M_N)}{P(D)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{main-posterior}
P(M_M|D) = \frac{P(D|M_M)P(M_M)}{P(D)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D) = P(M_N)P(D|M_N)+P(M_M)P(D|M_M)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Parameter Estimation and Model Comparison}
\label{monte-carlo}

The posterior probability distributions of section
\ref{discussion-posterior} constitute a complete description of the
author's beliefs about the models and their parameters, once the data
(chapter \ref{results}) are taken into account.  However, it is a very
unwieldy description, consisting as it does of two scalar fields
defined on a $47$-dimensional space.  A summary is required for
presentation.  The author believes that the most useful summary will
be to give, for each parameter $Q_m$, estimates of its posterior
marginal expectations
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_N> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_N)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_M> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_M)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and of its posterior marginal standard deviations,
\begin{equation}
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_N) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_N>-<Q_m|D, M_N>^2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_M) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_M>-<Q_m|D, M_M>^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
<Q_m^2|D, M_n> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_m^2P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The summary should also include the estimates of the model posterior
probabilities $P(M_n|D)$ (equations \ref{null-posterior},
\ref{main-posterior}.)

If a means can be found of drawing samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}$ from the distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$, where $i$ runs
from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to $J$, and the total number of
samples is, therefore, $IJ$, $<Q_m|D, M_n>$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH}
be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^JQ_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Similarly, $\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_n)$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH} be
estimated by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n)}
=\sqrt{\frac{IJ(\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
      i)}-(\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)})^2)}{IJ-1}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J((Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)})^2)}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Similarly, if a means can be found of drawing samples
$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i, j)}$ from the distribution
$P(\vc{Q}|M_n)$, where $i$ runs from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to
$J$, and the total number of samples is, therefore, $IJ$, $P(D|M_n)$
can \cite{Gallagher::MFH} be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n)} =
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^jP(D|\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i, j)})}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

All of these estimators are \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} non-Bayesian,
i.e.~they coincide exactly with Bayesian posterior expectations of the
quantities being estimated, given the samples, only for specific, but
not specified, prior probability distributions over moments of the
distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$.  The estimators will, therefore,
differ by an amount $\delta$ from the posterior expectations that
would be obtained with explicit statements of plausible prior
probability distributions over these moments, if this were technically
feasible.  Fortunately, however, the size of $\delta$ tends
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} to decrease with decreasing marginal
likelihood, i.e.~with increasing number of samples.  Equally
fortunately, when the inference process aims to estimate moments of a
probability distribution, from samples from that distribution, a
critical $\delta$ for each moment is made available, by the degree of
variation implied by the higher moments, such that significantly
smaller values of $\delta$ can be safely ignored.  All this means
that, for large numbers of samples, the non-Bayesian estimators are
acceptable.

The means of obtaining samples is the leapfrog method.  This is
explained in detail in \emph{Information Theory, Inference and
  Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, where it is attributed
to Skilling.  Each iteration of the method consists of the application
of a leapfrog proposal density, followed by the application of a
Metropolis decision algorithm.  For sampling from the posterior
probability distribution, after the $i$th iteration, the method's
state is a set of $J$ parameter vectors $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  j)}$, which are the samples to be used in the estimators.  The
leapfrog proposal density sets
\begin{equation}
\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)} = 2\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  k)}-\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where, for each $j$, a $k$ is chosen at random from the other $J-1$
integers from $1$ to $J$, with each of these being equi-probable.  The
Metropolis decision algorithm then works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}if $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
    M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)} \geq{} 1$, then
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set to
    $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$.  Otherwise,
  \item{}$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set at random, either
    to $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$, or to
    $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $1-\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$.
\end{itemize}
An analogous process is used to draw samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri},
  n, i, j)}$ from the prior probability distribution.

As part of the preparation of the present thesis, the author has
written Perl code that implements the leapfrog method; in the
transparent copy of this thesis, the code for the null model $M_N$ is
in the file \patio{null}, and the code for the main model $M_M$ is in
the file \patio{main}.  As far as the author has been able to
discover, the present thesis is the first use of the leapfrog method
to infer parameters and model likelihoods from real experimental data.
Some further details are needed to define the particular version of
the leapfrog method used in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Initial vector sets $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)}$ and
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ are chosen, centred around the
  analytically-derived prior expectation values $<Q_m|M_n>$ of the
  parameters.  The displacements of the $J$ initial vectors from the
  prior expectation are picked randomly from a perfect top-hat
  distribution out to a maximum size of each displacement component,
  which is the product of a constant factor $\alpha_{pri}$ or
  $\alpha_{pos}$, and the prior standard deviation $\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n)$
  of the relevant parameter.  That is to say, $Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n,
    0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{,}
\]
and $Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{.}
\]
It has \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} been shown that the leapfrog method
rapidly grows an initial vector set that is narrower than the
distribution, from which one wishes to sample.  However, the author
does not know of any analogous proof that the algorithm can shrink an
initial vector set that is broader than the distribution, from which
one wishes to sample.  Therefore, the initial vector set, for sampling
from the prior probability distribution is made a factor of
$\exp{}(1)$, in each dimension, narrower than the prior probability
distribution.  An attempt is made to achieve the same for the
posterior probability distribution, using a guess at the width of the
posterior probability distribution.  This gives $\alpha_{pri} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\exp{}(1)}$, and $\alpha_{pos} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{(|D|-A)\exp{}(1)}$, where $|D| = 1018$ is the number
of data points, and the number of adjustable parameters is $A = 39$
for the null model $M_N$, and $A = 46$ for the main model $M_M$,
because a parameter whose prior probability distribution is a Dirac
delta function is not truly adjustable.  One further complication is
that it is necessary to ensure that, in each dimension, the width of
the initial vector set is comfortably greater than the quantum of
floating point numbers of the order of magnitude of $<Q_m|M_n>$.
Mantissae have 53 bits `on typical hardware' \cite{Ramirez:2002:PD}.
One bit is assumed to be taken up by the sign, and four bits are left,
to provide 16 possible starting ordinates, i.e.~if the half-width of
the top-hat distribution is less than $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$, it is
adjusted to $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$.
\item{}The author believes that the number $J$ of state vectors
  maintained simultaneously, in the Monte Carlo algorithm, must be at
  least the number $A$ of adjustable parameters.  This is because
  every state vector ever obtained will be some linear combination of
  the $J$ initial state vectors, and to obtain a representative
  sample, the $J$ initial state vectors must, therefore, span the
  parameter space.  In this thesis, therefore, $J = 2A$ is chosen,
  rather than the $J = 6$ or $J = 12$ suggested in \emph{Information
    Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}.
\item{}The author also believes that having a large value of $J$ will
  ameliorate the problem, noted by MacKay \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, of
  the state vectors in the leapfrog algorithm becoming stuck
  permanently at one vector set, after it has converged, because, as
  long as the parameter of interest varies smoothly in $\vc{Q}$ space,
  as the $Q_m$ must, if $J \gg{} 1$, there will be a reasonable
  sampling of the distribution even if all the individual state
  vectors are stationary.  $P(D|\vc{Q}, M_n)$, however, might not vary
  smoothly is $\vc{Q}$ space.  Therefore, the quantitative estimates
  of $P(D|M_n)$ obtained herein should be treated with some
  scepticism.

Having presented and discussed the results of the main experiments, it
is now time to present results of some similar, earlier experiments;
the primary use of these experiments will not be in inferring physical
properties of samples, but in identifying imperfections in the
experimental methods, the solutions to which motivate, and are built
into, the experimental methods above.

\section{Intermediate Experiment 1}
\label{autumn-2001-experiments}

A preliminary experiment, related to this thesis, was described in
\emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
\cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  That report presents Mott asymmetries of
reflected electron beams from a $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ structure, using
the estimator of equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}.
Those measurements are of much lower precision than the measurements
presented in this thesis (chapter \ref{results}, section
\ref{traditional-estimation-section},) and the report remains of
interest primarily for its list of the adaptations that were made to
the polarimeter, and to the measurement technique, in order to bring
it into a sufficiently functional condition to undertake the
preliminary experiment.  That list is repeated in section
\ref{repeated-adaptation-list} of this thesis.  Similarly, this
section, and section \ref{july-2002-experiments}, are concerned with
the polarimetry measurements that were performed after the preliminary
experiment, and before the main experiment of part
\ref{main-experiment}, the technical adaptations that were discovered
to be necessary, as a result of those intermediate measurements, and
the implementation of those adaptations.

After the preliminary experiment, considerable resources were devoted
to equipment repairs, and to safety-related upgrades, which did not
constitute adaptations of the polarimeter, or of the measurement
technique.  Once this was done, concerted efforts began to produce
more decisive polarized electron reflection measurements than those in
that report, starting with pilot experiments on $Co/Cu(001)$
structures, without the added manganese; compared with most of the
preliminary measurements, lower beam energies were used in the
intermediate experiments, leading to more intense reflected beams, and
greater precision in the current (or electron arrival rate)
measurements at the channeltrons.

In the first such intermediate experiment, the method was very similar
to that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences
being that the channeltrons were used as Faraday cups, measuring
continuous currents, instead of counting individual electrons, and
that the position of the sample was only set to a precision of
$1\ut{mm}$ in translational degrees of freedom, and $1^{\circ}$ in the
rotational degree of freedom with the vertical rotation axis.  Some of
the results are displayed in table \ref{intthick1} and figures
% \ref{20011205_Polarimetry}, \ref{20011205_Polarimetry_2},
% \ref{20011206_Polarimetry}, \ref{20011121_Polarimetry},

In addition to the polarized electron reflection measurements, Auger
electron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction were used
for structural characterization of some of these samples.  They
revealed that the copper surfaces produced by a sputtering and
annealing process of similar extent to that in chapter \ref{results}
were clean and well ordered, and that a significant amount of cobalt
was being deposited.

A number of features of the data stand out.  Firstly, instead of being
downward sloping and convex $\cup$, the electron arrival rate as a
function of beam energy is upward sloping and concave $\cap$.  After
independent tests of the voltage arriving at the retarding grids
(figure \ref{sd},) this was attributed to the power supply in use for
the retarding grids having the wrong polarity to maintain a constant
energy loss window, resulting in an energy loss window that increased
at twice the rate of increase of the incident beam energy, and a
$\Gamma$ (figure \ref{HER_Average}) that increased with increasing
incident beam energy.  A new power supply, with the correct polarity,
was procured for the experiments described in section
\ref{july-2002-experiments} and section \ref{method}.  Secondly,
the electron arrival rate for a given set of conditions was not
reproduce-able, as is vividly displayed in the histograms of the
detector current, which are clearly multi-modal.  After independent
tests of the current arriving at a given detector, as the sample
position was varied, this was attributed to the variation in position
of the sample between different measurements, and a corresponding
variation in the fraction of the specularly reflected beam that was
accepted at the front of the polarimeter.  Fortunately, the same tests
indicated that a precision of $0.1\ut{mm}$ in the translational
degrees of freedom, and $0.1^{\circ}$ in the rotation about the
vertical axis, which was feasible with the available equipment (figure
\ref{holder},) would be adequate to render this effect negligible.
Thirdly, at the low incident beam energies, where the energy loss
window was in the region where $S$ is large enough to provide spin
sensitivity (figure \ref{HER_Sherman},) $\Gamma$ was so small as to
stretch the limits of the sensitivity of continuous current
measurements.  For subsequent experiments (section
\ref{july-2002-experiments}, section \ref{method},) therefore, a move
was made to single electron counting.  To succeed in this move
required the procurement and installation of new channeltrons.

\section{Intermediate Experiment 2}
\label{july-2002-experiments}

In the second intermediate experiment, the method was very similar to
that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences being
that longer dwell times were used, and more electron counts were
recorded, resulting in an experiment that lasted around $17\ut{hours}$
for each film thickness, rather than the $2\ut{hours}$ or so of the
experiment in part \ref{main-experiment}.  Some of the results are
displayed in table \ref{intthick2}, and figures
% \ref{20020708_Polarimetry}, \ref{20020709_Polarimetry},

and
\ref{20020724_Polarimetry_6}.  A sample described as ``slightly
dirty'' has been left in non-UHV conditions (gas pressure greater than
$10\ut{pbar}$) for a few hours, and a sample described as ``very
dirty'' has been left in non-UHV conditions for around a day.  Readers

In addition to the polarized electron reflection experiments, one of
the author's colleagues confirmed using MOKE measurements that the
films on substrates 5 and 7 were ferromagnetic \cite{Kopper:2002:ESP}.

In many cases, the electron arrival rate appears not to be a smooth
function of the incident beam energy.  Inspection of the detailed data
sets, based on the counts in single periods of $\tau$, rather than of
$256\tau$, reveals that this is associated with a gradual variation in
time of the count rate, for fixed conditions\footnote{These detailed
data sets are available in the transparent copy of this thesis, in the
files whose names contain the word ``detailed.''}.  The variations are
tentatively attributed to drift in the detection efficiencies of the
channeltrons, and have an amplitude of approximately $10\%$ of the
average sensitivity peak-to-peak, on a time-scale of the order of a
few hours.  This is the reason for much faster experiments being used
in the main experiment of this chapter.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{experiment-conclusions}

Having presented and analysed the experimental results, it is time to
summarize the conclusions that can be drawn from these results.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}A non-zero Weiss field in the cobalt films has been detected;
  according to the Bayesian model comparison method, the experimental
  data rule out the null hypothesis, in which no such field has been
  detected, very strongly indeed, leaving it with a posterior
  probability of \input{null-posterior}; this is about as firm a
  conclusion as it is conceivable to obtain, although properties of
  the Monte Carlo method used to estimate this probability suggest
  that some caution should be applied to the sheer size of the number.
\item{}The traditional estimator of the Mott asymmetry, and therefore
  of the reflected electron beam's spin polarization, provides
  well-defined, mostly non-zero values, indicating, in support of the
  last aforesaid Bayesian conclusion, that, despite the systematic
  error in the electron arrival rates, described below, the
  experiments have successfully detected the cobalt's Weiss field.
\item{}The experimental results can be used to estimate quantitatively
  the electrostatic potential $V$ and Weiss field $B$ in the samples;
  the estimates obtained, using the Bayesian parameter estimation
  method, are shown in figures \ref{estatpotmain} and
  \ref{magfluxmain}.  As can be seen from the figures, the estimates
  produced are extremely imprecise, i.e.~the quoted standard deviation
  random errors in them are very large.  The bulk of the large random
  error does not result from the posterior probability distribution,
  over the electrostatic potential or Weiss field, having a wide peak,
  but rather from this probability distribution having two
  widely-separated peaks, associated with the fact that the
  theoretical equation \ref{polarization}, when inverted to give the
  ratio $\frac{B}{V}$, as a function of the measurable reflected beam
  polarization, gives two solutions for $\frac{B}{V}$, for any given
  polarization; however, the moderately large random errors found in
  the traditional estimators of Mott asymmetry, related to the fact
  that the measured beam polarization is, in some sense, a small
  difference between two large numbers (the spin-up and spin-down
  currents,) suggest that each of the two peaks will itself be quite
  broad.  Ironically, this lack of precision contributes positively to
  the ability to draw such an immensely firm conclusion that a
  non-zero Weiss field has been detected; underlying the Occam's razor
  that implements \cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} itself
  automatically in Bayesian statistics is the idea that a model should
  not be allowed to use information from experimental data to
  fine-tune its adjustable parameters, then recycle the same
  information to support it against other models.  In the problem at
  hand, the model with extra adjustable parameters (non-zero Weiss
  fields in the cobalt films) does not significantly fine-tune those
  parameters using the experimental data, as is evident from the large
  residual random errors in those parameters.  Therefore, Occam's
  razor does not significantly penalise this model, relative to the
  simpler model with the Weiss fields fixed at zero.
\item{}The spin polarization produced by the cobalt's Weiss field, as
  estimated in traditional fashion, is of a similar order of magnitude
  ($\sim{}10\%$) to that found by other workers in various independent
  laboratories, using polarized electron reflection from other
  ferro-magnetic transition metals (section
  \ref{experimental-context}.)
\item{}There is some strong evidence that the stray magnetic field of
  the sample (or of some part of the sample holder) is significantly
  affecting the electron trajectories, creating a
  magnetization-dependent systematic error in the measured electron
  arrival rates at the Mott polarimeter's detectors.
\end{enumerate}

The genuine effect of the cobalt's Weiss field can be detected, even
in the presence of the systematic error due to stray magnetic fields,
because the two have significantly different signatures in the
electron arrival rates at the channeltrons.  When the sample
magnetization is reversed, the characteristic behaviour caused by the
stray-field systematic error is for the electron arrival rates, at the
two channeltrons, to change by the same factor, in the same sense,
i.e.~either both increase, or both decrease.  The characteristic
behaviour caused by a genuine spin polarization, produced by the
cobalt's Weiss field, on the other hand, is for the electron arrival
rates, at the two channeltrons, to change by the same factor, in
opposite senses, i.e.~one increases and the other decreases.  It was
also this dissimilarity in signatures that allowed the systematic
error to be noticed in the first place (table
\ref{movement-directions}.)

In physical terms, the various methods used to analyse the data,
namely the least-squares curve fitting of chapter \ref{results}, the
asymmetry estimation of section \ref{traditional-estimation-section},
and the Bayesian inference of section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}
are all seeking the same effect, notwithstanding their substantial
differences of statistical approach.  All of them are testing for the
electron arrival rates changing, on sample magnetization reversal, by
the same factor in opposite senses.  All of them are, therefore,
sensitive to genuine spin polarizations, rather than to the
stray-field systematic error, and all of them declare decisively that
they have found such polarizations.

Of course, it is possible for both a genuine polarization and a stray
field to occur simultaneously, and for their effects to be
superimposed on one another.  This appears to be the case in the
experiments discussed in the present thesis.  In this case, the
systematic error in the electron arrival rates, caused by the stray
field, has the following two effects.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Quantitative estimation of the polarizations, and therefore of
  the electro-magnetic parameters of the sample, by any of the data
  processing methods, is rather imprecise, i.e.~has a large random
  error; however, this effect does not dominate the standard deviation
  random errors found in the estimates of electro-magnetic parameters,
  the bulk of which result from the double-valued nature of equation
  \ref{polarization}, when inverted to give electro-magnetic parameters
  as a function of spin polarization.
\item{}Visual inspection of the electron arrival rate data cannot
  easily pick out the individual effects (genuine spin polarization
  and stray field) from the superposition of the two.
\end{enumerate}

It would, therefore, be much better if a way were found to eliminate
the stray field, both to make the essential physical process of spin
polarization by the exchange interaction more obvious visually, and to
improve quantitative estimation of the Weiss field involved.  Lind
\cite{Lind:1987:SSG} found such a method for his particular
experimental configuration, which involved following the field applied
to magnetize the sample with a smaller applied field, in the opposite
direction.  It is, however, unclear how Lind determined that this
method was a success, what physical mechanism allows the technique to
work, and whether it will be applicable to experimental apparatus
other than Lind's, such as the apparatus used for the present thesis.

Having drawn conclusions from the experimental results hereinbefore
presented, some suggestions will now be given as to future research
directions related to the work in this thesis.

\section{Suggestions for Further Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item{}It would be intriguing to attempt to repeat Lind's
  \cite{Lind:1987:SSG} method of eliminating the stray-field
  systematic error, by following the applied field used to set the
  sample magnetization direction with a smaller applied field in the
  opposite direction.  As well as experimental reproduction of the
  technique, some theorizing would be in order, in the hope of
  understanding the physical mechanisms behind it.
\item{}As a complement to attempts to eliminate the spatial deflection
  of the electron beam by a stray field from the sample or sample
  holder, there may be benefits in attempting to use this spatial
  deflection, along with spatially-resolved detection of the reflected
  beam, as an alternative means of determining a sample's magnetic
  state using an electron beam.
\item{}The numerical method, presented in this thesis, for obtaining
  summary data about the Bayesian posterior probability distributions,
  given the experimental data presented here, has performed
  disappointingly: it was very slow to run, taking CPU time of the
  order of a month to reach the conclusions presented here, and even
  after this time, there remains some doubt over whether it has
  reached a final conclusion on the marginal likelihoods used for
  model comparison, given that the likelihood function may not vary
  smoothly in parameter space.  The slowness is in large part due to
  the many extra adjustable parameters, which have had to be inserted
  into the physical models, to handle the systematic errors now
  attributed to stray magnetic fields, and experimental techniques
  that eliminate these errors may resolve the problems with the
  numerical method.  Nevertheless, there may be benefits in exploring
  alternative numerical methods, particularly if it is possible to
  increase the simplicity of their implementation by using adaptations
  of widely-available fitting software, rather than having to program
  a Markov chain Monte Carlo method anew; since completing the
  analysis herein presented, the author has, in the course of a
  separate experimental project, made considerable progress in
  devising means whereby, with a little algebra, ubiquitous
  chi-squared fitting routines can be used for Bayesian parameter
  estimation and model comparison.
\item{}It will soon be necessary to consider what kinds of samples it
  is most interesting to examine with the polarized electron
  reflection technique; the $Co/Cu(001)$ structure considered in this
  thesis was chosen primarily as a trial system, for development of
  the instrumentation.  Above, the $c(2\times{}2)$ surface alloy of
  manganese on a cobalt $(001)$ surface, with a copper substrate, was
  also mentioned as a candidate system for examination by polarized
  electron reflection.  The author would characterize the motivation
  for experiments on this alloy as aesthetic: the wish to peer deeper
  into a beautiful and unusual system.  The author has discussed with
  colleagues a number of other combinations of copper, cobalt, and
  manganese, which hold similar interest.  However, as has been
  discussed elsewhere \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, the author now takes the
  view that the scientific value of experimental results stems
  primarily not from their aesthetic appeal, but from their ability to
  help policy-makers reach better decisions.  In the case of research
  in magnetic film structures, the most relevant policy-makers are
  managers in the magnetic data storage industry, and the most
  relevant decisions are those about which systems of magnetic
  materials to include in future hard discs, read heads, and magnetic
  random access memories.  The author believes that the time is ripe
  to consult managers in this industry about how they can use
  information about the Weiss fields of materials in multi-layer
  structures, and what multi-layer structures are most important to
  them.
