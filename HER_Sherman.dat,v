@# These are the Sherman function values from figure 3 of Burnett:1994:HER,
# as estimated, roughly, from the graph: by "roughly," I mean that the Sherman
# functions are quantized in units of 0.025, and creating a standard
# deviation error of 0.008.  This uncertainty dominates over any systematic
# error due to the use of Sherman functions for 20keV scattering energy, rather
# than the 21keV electrons used in the PER experiments described here, but is
# comparable with the errors quoted on the graph, and must therefore be
# combined in quadrature with them.
# 1st column: energy loss window (eV)
