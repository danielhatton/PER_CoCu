\markboth{ABSTRACT}{ABSTRACT}

A theory of polarized electron reflection, at the surface of a
magnetic material, is devised, predicting that the rate of electrons
leaving the surface will be
\begin{equation}
G = \left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and that the reflected beam's polarization will be
\begin{equation}
P =
-\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eVB}{12e^2m_e^2V^2+e^2\hbar^2B^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
$V$ represents the electrostatic potential inside the material, $B$
the Weiss field inside the material, $I$ the angle of incidence of the
electron beam, $E_b$ each incident electron's kinetic energy, and
$F/e$ the rate of electron incidence.  The equations represent a
lowest order Taylor expansion in $\frac{1}{E_b}$, which, for cobalt
samples, renders them applicable as long as $E_b \gg{}
\sim{}700\ut{meV}$.  They also involve an assumption that that the
topmost layer of the sample has a thickness $\gg{} 1\ut{nm}$.

Measurements are presented of spin-correlated electron arrival rates
at a Mott-polarimeter's two detectors, from the reflected electron beam
from $Co/Cu(001)$, as a function of cobalt thickness, incident energy,
and incident intensity.  Example results are displayed graphically in
chapter \ref{results}.  They are analysed using three distinct
methodologies.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Visual inspection of the data is used to make qualitative
  suggestions about future directions for modelling of electron
  reflection processes at magnetic surfaces.  A
  magnetization-dependent systematic error is discovered in electron
  arrival rates at the polarimeter's detectors, and is tentatively
  attributed to the deflection of the electron beam by a stray
  magnetic field, from the sample, or from some part of the sample
  holder.  This raises the possibility, for the future, of using a
  reflected electron beam's spatial deflection, rather than its spin
  polarization, to characterize magnetic samples.
\item{}A traditional estimator of the Mott asymmetry, associated with
  the reflected polarization, is calculated for each combination of
  film thickness, incident energy, and incident intensity.  Results
  are displayed graphically in section
  \ref{traditional-estimation-section}.  The polarizations of most
  reflected beams from cobalt films are clearly non-zero, indicating
  that the experiment has successfully detected the cobalt's Weiss
  field.  Quantitative determination of this polarization is, however,
  rather imprecise, and there is a puzzling non-zero asymmetry from
  the bare copper surface.
\item{}It is argued that the accuracy of the traditional estimator may
  be compromised by its non-linearity in the electron arrival rates;
  therefore, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the parameters in
  two adaptive models, based on the above theory, and to estimate
  relative probabilities for these models, equipped with the data.
  One model has a non-zero Weiss field in the films, the other does
  not.  Results of the parameter estimation are displayed graphically
  in sections \ref{adaptive-models} and \ref{further-conclusions};
  quantitative estimation of the sample properties is, as for the
  traditional estimator, rather imprecise.  The data are found to rule
  out a null hypothesis, in which the cobalt's Weiss field is zero,
  very strongly, leaving it with a posterior probability of
  \input{null-posterior}, indicating firmly that the experiment has
  successfully detected the cobalt's Weiss field.
\end{enumerate}

These measurements were preceded by a process (sections
\ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{july-2002-experiments}) of trial
and error, in which attempted measurements of the spin polarization of
reflected electron beams revealed sources of systematic error, which
were addressed by adaptations to the polarimeter, and to the
experimental technique.

\chapter*{Medium Abstract}

A theory of polarized electron reflection, at the surface of a
magnetic material, treating the material as a classical
electro-magnetic field, is (chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}) devised.
This theory predicts that the rate of electrons leaving the surface,
in the specularly reflected beam, will be
\begin{equation}
G = \left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and that the reflected beam's polarization will be of magnitude
\begin{equation}
P =
-\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eVB}{12e^2m_e^2V^2+e^2\hbar^2B^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
in the direction of the effective magnetic flux density inside the
material.  $V$ represents the electrostatic potential inside the
material, $B$ the effective magnetic flux density inside the material,
$I$ the angle of incidence of the electron beam, $E_b$ the kinetic
energy of the incident electrons, and $F/e$ the rate of electron
arrival in the incident beam.  The equations above represent a lowest
order Taylor expansion in $\frac{1}{E_b}$.

Measurements are presented (chapter \ref{results}) of the
spin-correlated electron arrival rates at the two detectors of a Mott
polarimeter, from the reflected electron beam from $Co/Cu(001)$, as a
function of cobalt thickness, incident energy, and incident intensity;

These results are analysed using three distinct methodologies.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Visual inspection of the data is (section \ref{visual}) used to
  make qualitative suggestions about future directions for the
  modelling of electron reflection processes at magnetic surfaces.
  The data suggest that effect of magnetization reversal on the
  electron detection rates at the channeltrons does not proceed solely
  through reversal of the spin polarization of the reflected electron
  beam.  This could be explained either by the electrons' spatial
  deflection picking up (measuring) a stray magnetic field from the
  sample, or by the detection efficiencies of channeltrons changing,
  when they are switched off, then on again.
\item{}Bayesian inference is (appendix \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff})
  used to estimate the parameters in two adaptive models, based on the
  above theory, and to estimate relative probabilities for these
  models, equipped with the data.  One model allows for the
  possibility of a non-zero effective magnetic flux density in the
  films, the other does not.  Estimated parameters are displayed in
  figures \ref{estatpotnull}, \ref{estatpotmain}, and
  \ref{magfluxmain}, and in tables \ref{null-compare} and
  \ref{main-compare}.  In the light of the data, the model with
  magnetic effects is strongly preferred to that without magnetic
  effects; the latter's probability of correctness is estimated at
  \input{null-posterior}.
\item{}A traditional estimator of the Mott asymmetry, associated with
  the reflected polarization, is (section
  \ref{traditional-estimation-section}) calculated for each
  combination of film thickness, incident energy, and incident
  intensity.  Results are displayed in figures
  \ref{20020919_Polarimetry_1_asyms},
  \ref{20020920_Polarimetry_1_asyms},
  \ref{20020920_Polarimetry_2_asyms},

  \ref{20020922_Polarimetry_1_asyms},
  \ref{20020923_Polarimetry_1_asyms}, and
  \ref{20020923_Polarimetry_2_asyms}.  The value of the estimator,
  under most conditions, is clearly non-zero, which is indicative of
  the successful detection of magnetic effects.
\end{enumerate}

The experiment reported in the main body of this thesis is the
culmination of a long process of trial and error, in which a programme
of adaptations to the polarimeter, and to the experimental technique,
was alternated with attempted measurements of the spin polarization of
reflected electron beams, which led to the identification of
systematic errors to be addressed, by further adaptations.  The
adaptations that led to the first polarization measurement are
described in appendix \ref{repeated-adaptation-list}.  The results of
that first measurement are not present in this thesis; they were
reported in \emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
\cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}, and are of very low precision, compared with
later measurements.  The two intermediate series of measurements, and
the adaptations that were adopted in response to them, are described
in appendices \ref{autumn-2001-experiments} and
\ref{july-2002-experiments}.

Some observations, on the implications of Bayesian statistics for
research projects, follow.

Bayesians perform inference by applying Bayes' theorem
\begin{equation}
P(T|E)=\frac{P(E|T)P(T)}{P(E)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where the prior probability $P(T)$ represents the degree of belief in
theory $T$, from a set $S$ of available theories, before the
occurrence of evidence $E$, the posterior probability $P(T|E)$
represents the degree of belief in $T$ after the occurrence of $E$,
the likelihood $P(E|T)$ is the probability that $T$ assigns to the
occurrence of $E$, and $P(E) = \sum_{T\in{}S}P(E|T)P(T)$.

The Bayesian world-view is found to differ from positivism in four
ways.  Firstly, the positivist Occam's razor insists that $P(T) =
P_0\epsilon{}^n$, where $n$ is the number of postulates in $T$, and
$P_0$ is a normalizing constant to ensure $\sum_{T\in{}S}P(T) = 1$,
whereas in the Bayesian view, $P(T)$ is a subjective and arbitrary
choice.  Secondly, positivism prohibits the entry of prescriptive
ideologies into knowledge, whereas Bayes' theorem allows inferences to
be drawn about prescriptive ideologies and descriptive theories alike.
Thirdly, a prohibition on theories $T$, for which one cannot conceive
of any evidence $E$, for which $P(E|T) = 0$, is sometimes associated
with positivism, whereas Bayesian analysis can assess many such
theories.  Fourthly, any positivist prohibition on the consideration
of evidence obtained with an ideology in mind is another example of
insistence on the assignment of particular values to prior
probabilities.  Therefore, Bayesians, like standpoint epistemologists,
will think such a prohibition inappropriate.

Bayesians view subjectivity as entering, inevitably, into academic
study by four routes.  Firstly, Bayesian inference cannot be performed
without the use of a prior probability distribution, mirroring
standpoint epistemologists' view that previous experience always
affects the interpretation of evidence.  For a Bayesian, the choice of
prior probability distribution is arbitrary and subjective, and any
attempt to achieve objectivity, by claiming that a particular prior
probability distribution is correct, conceals this subjective choice,
and renders it immutable.  Bayesians conceptualize objectivity as the
achievement of similar posterior probability distributions, from a
range of prior probability distributions, mirroring standpoint
epistemologists' view that theoretical beliefs need to be grounded by
combining the conclusions of researchers with diverse previous
experiences.  If evidence has been noted, for which some theories have
not produced likelihood values, a prior probability distribution can
be devised which approximates the posterior probability distribution
which the previous evidence would have produced, mirroring standpoint
epistemologists' view that thinking on the basis of evidence, which
has been obtained in the course of a marginalized lives, can improve
the ability of researchers to interpret other evidence, whether or not
they themselves experienced those marginalized lives.

Secondly, the Bayesian statistical decision theory uses the expected
reduction, which an experiment will bring about, in an uncertainty
function of the prior or posterior probability distribution, to judge
the worth of an experiment, and therefore to choose experiments.  It
can be shown that every uncertainty function is associated with an
ideology, for which it measures how much an experiment's results can
improve the making of policy choices to implement that ideology.
Bayesians may, therefore, suspect that claims that a particular piece
of research is free of ideology conceal the inevitable influence of
ideology in the selection of its experiments.  This suspicion is
shared with standpoint epistemology, and proponents of both traditions
prefer to be open about the ideological motivation of their research.

Thirdly, ideology may also enter into academic study through attempts
to produce a posterior probability distribution, in which the policy
which will minimize the expectation of one's own loss function is the
same policy which will minimize the expectation of the loss function
of someone else with decision-making power.  This possibility, against
which Bayesian thinking can provide some protection, has been noted by
standpoint epistemologists, as an abuse of science.

Fourthly, the prior probability distribution can affect the posterior
probability distribution through experiment selection.  In a toy
problem, it is found that whichever of two theories has the higher
prior probability is able to make an experiment which confirms it
appear to be the most interesting experiment to undertake, and thereby
to enhance its probability.  This may be related to certain recent
epistemological observations, outside of the standpoint epistemology
tradition.

Physicists have a tendency to study phenomena at very large and very
small length scales.  This can be modelled as the result of experiment
selection, under statistical decision theory, using a greedy top-down
approximation to the Shannon entropy as the uncertainty function.
However, the greedy top-down approximation may be less appropriate to
progress through increasing complication, than to progress through
increasing size or energy.

\section*{Polarized Electron Reflection: Theory}

A theory of polarized electron reflection, at the surface of a
magnetic material, treating the material as a classical
electro-magnetic field, with sudden steps in electrostatic potential
and magnetic flux density at the surface, is devised (chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}.)  This theory predicts that the rate of
electrons leaving the surface, in the specularly reflected beam, will
be
\begin{equation}
G = \left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and that the reflected beam's polarization will be of magnitude
\begin{equation}
P =
-\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eVB}{12e^2m_e^2V^2+e^2\hbar^2B^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
in the direction of the effective magnetic flux density inside the
material.  $V$ represents the electrostatic potential inside the
material, $B$ the effective magnetic flux density inside the material,
$I$ the angle of incidence of the electron beam, $E_b$ the kinetic
energy of the incident electrons, and $F/e$ the rate of electron
arrival in the incident beam.  Each of these formulae is a Taylor
expansion, to lowest order in the ratios of $V$ and $B$ to $E_b$.

\section*{Polarized Electron Reflection: Experiment}

Measurements are presented (chapter \ref{results}) of the
spin-correlated electron arrival rates at the two detectors of a Mott
polarimeter, from the reflected electron beam from $Co/Cu(001)$, as a
function of cobalt thickness, incident energy, and incident intensity;
the results are displayed in figures % \ref{20020919_Polarimetry_1_2},

% \ref{20020923_Polarimetry_2_6}.

These results are analysed using three distinct methodologies.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Visual inspection of the data is (section \ref{visual}) used to
  make qualitative suggestions about future directions for the
  modelling of electron reflection processes at magnetic surfaces.
  The data suggest that effect of magnetization reversal on the
  electron detection rates at the channeltrons does not proceed solely
  through reversal of the spin polarization of the reflected electron
  beam. This leads to the exciting possibility, for further
  theoretical investigation, that the spatial deflection of the
  electrons, by the stray magnetic field from the sample, is
  sufficiently affected by the sample magnetization, that it provides
  a means of using an electron beam to probe sample magnetic
  properties, without the necessity of spin polarization measurement,
  which is technically difficult.  It also raises the alternative
  possibility that the detection efficiency of a channeltron changes,
  on switching it off then on again.  The latter is more a matter for
  change in experimental technique (keeping the channeltrons switched
  on throughout sets of measurements that are to be directly compared)
  than for detailed theoretical investigation.
\item{}Bayesian inference is (appendix \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff})
  used to estimate the parameters in two adaptive models, based on the
  classical-field theory, and to estimate relative probabilities for
  these models, equipped with the data.  One model allows for the
  possibility of a non-zero effective magnetic flux density in the
  cobalt films, the other does not.  The most interesting parameters
  of the models are the electrostatic potentials, and effective
  magnetic flux densities in the samples, and the estimates of these,
  based on the experimental data, are displayed in figures
  \ref{estatpotnull}, \ref{estatpotmain}, and \ref{magfluxmain}.  The
  low precision of these estimates is surprising, given the extent of
  the data set.  Tables \ref{null-compare} and \ref{main-compare} show
  the estimated values of all the parameters, both with and without
  taking account of the experimental data, and reveal that the low
  precision of the estimated characteristics of the samples extends to
  the characteristics of the instruments.  However, the experimental
  data are very decisive in supporting the model with the possibility
  of a non-zero effective magnetic flux density in the cobalt films,
  over the model without this possibility; the probability of
  correctness of the non-magnetic model is estimated at
  \input{null-posterior}.
\item{}A traditional estimator of the Mott asymmetry, associated with
  the reflected polarization, is (section
  \ref{traditional-estimation-section}) calculated for each
  combination of film thickness and incident energy.  Results are
  displayed in figures \ref{20020919_Polarimetry_1_asyms},
  \ref{20020920_Polarimetry_1_asyms},
  \ref{20020920_Polarimetry_2_asyms},

  \ref{20020923_Polarimetry_1_asyms}, and
  \ref{20020923_Polarimetry_2_asyms}.  The value of the estimator,
  under most conditions, is clearly non-zero, which is indicative of
  the successful detection of magnetic effects.

The need to interpret (appendix \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}) the
results of the experiments at the core of this thesis, along with the
detailed consideration of the motivation for those experiments
(chapter \ref{motive},) has led the author to give considerable
thought, during the course of this research project, to the
implications of Bayesian statistics for physical science research, and
for research in other disciplines.  The remainder of this abstract
concerns the resulting observations.

The Bayesian perspective involves using probabilities to represent
degrees of belief.  It implements both inductive and deductive
reasoning through Bayes' theorem
\begin{equation}
P(T|E)=\frac{P(E|T)P(T)}{P(E)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
which generates the posterior probability $P(T|E)$, representing the
degree of belief in a theory $T$, in the light of observational or
experimental evidence $E$, from the likelihood $P(E|T)$, which is the
probability that $T$ assigns to the occurrence of $E$, the prior
probability $P(T)$, representing the degree of belief in $T$, before
the occurrence of $E$, and the marginal likelihood $P(E)$, which is
the average $\sum_{T\in{}S}P(E|T)P(T)$, over the set $S$ of available
theories, of the likelihood.

This thesis aims to use Bayesian methods to provide a mathematical
re-statement of certain recent epistemological arguments, in
particular those associated with standpoint epistemology, which have
previously been expressed in natural-language terms.  It is then hoped
to apply Bayesian arguments to current directions in the physical
sciences.

\section*{Orthodox Science: The Principles of Positivism}

To this end, an attempt is made to build a Bayesian mathematical model
of positivism.  The positivist principle of phenomenalism is found to
apply only mild constraints to the prior probability distribution,
such as a Bayesian might use to prevent a situation from arising, in
which beliefs are incapable of being swayed by evidence.  The form of
Occam's razor used in positivist philosophy, on the other hand, is
modelled as a claim that a particular prior probability distribution,
in which the prior probability of any particular theory $T$ is
\begin{equation}
P(T)=P_0\epsilon^n\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $P_0$ is a normalizing constant, the same for all theories,
$\epsilon$ is a constant equivalent to the likelihood value at which a
theory is taken to be falsified, and $n$ is the number of postulates
in theory $T$, is correct, and that any other assignment of prior
probabilities is invalid.  This places the positivist Occam's razor in
a tradition known as logical probability, which is alien to the modern
Bayesian standpoint.  The positivist prohibition on the entry of
prescriptive ideologies into knowledge is also found to be a
restriction which is unnecessary for a Bayesian, who is permitted, but
not obliged, to assess descriptive theories and prescriptive
ideologies by the same inference method.  Finally, the positivist
assertion that knowledge from different academic disciplines must be
capable of concatenation into a single body of knowledge is found to
be nothing more than a prohibition on self-contradictory theories.

Various other limitations on the kinds of evidence which can be
allowed to enter into knowledge, which are sometimes incorporated into
positivism, are also considered in Bayesian terms.  Firstly,
deterministic falsificationism, in which only evidence $E$ that
completely rules out a theory $T$, i.e.~that has $P(T|E) = P(E|T) =
0$, is allowed to influence belief in that theory, is argued to be an
unnecessary restriction, since Bayes' theorem can draw inferences
about the truth of $T$ from a much wider range of evidence.  Secondly,
a prohibition on evidence obtained with an ideology in mind is found,
in Bayesian inference, to be equivalent to setting the prior
probability $P(T)$ to zero for any theory $T$ in which, for a piece of
evidence $E$ which was obtained with an ideology in mind, $P(E|T)
\neq{} P(E|\bar{T})$.  Such a prohibition is, therefore, another
example of logical probability, and is not part of the Bayesian view.
Thirdly, reductionism, in which it is assumed that the single body of
knowledge, which positivism predicts will be produced by the
concatenation of theories from different academic disciplines, will
take the form of the laws of physics, is found, depending on its
interpretation, either to add nothing to the core principles of
positivism described above, or to insist on the assignment of low
prior probabilities to all theories which are incapable of expression
in a particular kind of mathematical language, associating
reductionism with logical probability and dissociating it from
Bayesian statistics.

\section*{The Appearance of Subjectivity in Academic Study}

Having established that Bayesian inference differs from positivist
inference in important respects, the theme is emphasized that, for a
Bayesian, it is inevitable that there are subjective influences in
academic study.  The first route for subjectivity arriving in academic
study is through the initial prior probability distribution, which
represents the beliefs that are held, about which theory is true,
before any evidence is observed, and without which no Bayesian
inference can be performed.  In the Bayesian perspective, the initial
prior probability distribution is an arbitrary and subjective choice,
and the claim, in the tradition of logical probability, that a
particular prior probability distribution is correct and other choices
are wrong, is seen as concealing and rendering immutable this
arbitrary choice.

Instead of claiming objective supremacy for a particular prior
probability distribution, Bayesians seek to construct objective
conclusions by gathering enough evidence that similar posterior
probability distributions can be reached, starting from a wide range
of different prior probability distributions.  This corresponds to the
construction of objectivity in standpoint epistemology, where it is
argued that theory can only be sufficiently grounded by combining the
conclusions of researchers whose prior beliefs are diverse.

Standpoint epistemologists further argue that the prior beliefs of
researchers are formed by their previous social experience, and that
those who have been marginalized in society have experiences, and
therefore prior beliefs, which can lead to greater insights than are
available to those who have been privileged.  Bayesians can
conceptualize this as an example of a common approximation in Bayesian
inference, which is used when evidence $E$ has been noted, for which
some theories $T$ have not developed in such a way as to provide
likelihood values $P(E|T)$, and which cannot, therefore, be used to
infer posterior probabilities $P(T|E)$, from prior probabilities
$P_0(T)$, through Bayes' theorem; instead, a prior probability $P(T)$
is used for future inference which attempts to estimate $P(T|E)$.  It
is noteworthy that the experiences of the marginalized can be taken
into account, as standpoint epistemologists argue, by marginalized and
privileged alike, obviating any need for ``extra votes'' for the
marginalized.

Subjectivity also enters into academic study through the role of
ideology in the selection of experiments.  Statistical decision
theory, which provides for Bayesian experiment selection, assumes
that, for a set of available theories $S$, there is an uncertainty
function $U(S)$ of the prior probabilities $P(T)$, $T \in{} S$, which
represents how much is to be learned about which theory is true.  The
same uncertainty function, denoted $U(S|E)$, of the posterior
probabilities $P(T|E)$, then represents how much remains to be learned
about which theory is true, after an experiment $X$, with a set of
possible results $R_X$, produces result $E \in{} R_X$.  Before the
experiment $X$ is performed, one can know the expectation of the
uncertainty after it is performed,
\begin{equation}
U(S|X) = \sum_{E\in{}R_X}P(E)U(S|E)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and can therefore measure the worth of the experiment by its
information, defined as the expected reduction in uncertainty
\begin{equation}
I(X;S) = U(S)-U(S|X)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and select experiments by offsetting their information against the
direct moral and financial costs of performing the experiment.  The
link with ideology arises through the means, by which the uncertainty
function is chosen.  The ideology which is to be implemented is
represented by a loss function $L(y;T)$, which measures how bad the
state of the universe will be, from the point of view of that
ideology, if a policy $y$, from a set $Y$ of possible policies, is
adopted, and theory $T \in{} S$ is true.  The uncertainty, the
quantity which one seeks to reduce by performing experiments, is then
the expectation of the loss function, when the policy, which minimizes
that expectation, is adopted
\begin{equation}
U(S) = \min_{y\in{}Y}\sum_{T\in{}S}P(T)L(y;T)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Moreover, \emph{any} continuous uncertainty function, which obeys the
intuitive principle that no experiment can have a negative
information, can be associated with an ideology through the above
equation.  Bayesians may, therefore, suspect that claims that a piece
of research is free of ideology conceal the inevitable influence of
ideology in the selection of its experiments.  This suspicion is
shared with standpoint epistemology, and proponents of both traditions
prefer to be open about the ideological motivation of their research.

In addition to the mechanisms discussed above, ideology may enter into
academic study through attempts to produce a posterior probability
distribution, in which the policy, which will minimize the expectation
of one's own loss function, is the same policy that will minimize the
expectation of the loss function of someone else with decision-making
power, i.e.~through the use of research as a coalition-building tool.

When those associated with standpoint epistemology assert that science
in Nazi Germany was used to ``depoliticize'' repressive policies, they
appear to be referring to to an attempt to interpret scientific
evidence in a manner which induced individuals, who were not
necessarily Nazis themselves, to tolerate Nazi policies.  In the
standpoint epistemologists' analysis, this was achieved by making one
theory, in which the consequences of not following Nazi policies
appeared almost as bad as those of following Nazi policies, appear to
be certainly true.  The probabilistic nature of truth, as espoused by
Bayesians, provides some protection against such a deception.
However, even with Bayesian thinking, it is possible to rig a prior
probability distribution, to produce a posterior probability
distribution which has this de-politicizing property.

The prior probability distribution also has an effect on the posterior
probability distribution through experiment selection.  A toy problem
can be constructed, in which there are two known theories, $T_1$ and
$T_2$, a deterministic, as yet unknown, absolutely true theory $T_0$,
and two possible experiments, $X$ and $Z$.  $T_1$ predicts results for
$X$, which agree with those from $T_0$ deterministically, and results
for $Z$, which disagree with those from $T_0$ with high probability,
while $T_2$ predicts results for $X$, which disagree with those from
$T_0$ with high probability, and results for $Z$, which agree with
those from $T_0$ deterministically.  Using statistical decision
theory, with the Shannon entropy as uncertainty function, to choose
one experiment to undertake, it is found that whichever theory is
assigned the higher prior probability is able to make the experiment
that confirms it appear to be the most interesting experiment, and
thereby to enhance its probability.  This may be related to certain
recent epistemological observations, outside of the standpoint
epistemology tradition.

\section*{Experiment Selection in Modern Physics: Size, Energy, and
  Complication}

Physicists have a tendency to study phenomena at very large and very
small length scales.  This can be modelled as the result of experiment
selection, under statistical decision theory, using a greedy top-down
approximation to the Shannon entropy as the uncertainty function.
However, the greedy top-down approximation may be less appropriate to
progress through increasing complication, than to progress through
increasing size or energy.
