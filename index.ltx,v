\chapter{Motivation}

This chapter describes the motivations for undertaking the theoretical
and experimental study, of polarized electron reflection from a
$Co/Cu(001)$ structure, presented in this thesis.  The material in
this chapter will be repeated in section \ref{motive}, and much of it
may seem more lucid there, after an introduction to the theoretical
principles surrounding polarized electron reflection studies; it is
reproduced here because some understanding of the motives for the
study is likely to be helpful in reading that theoretical
introduction.

Colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory had earlier performed a series
of measurements on the system formed by growing a $0.5\ut{ML}$
$Mn/6\ut{ML}$ $Co/Cu(001)$ multi-layer \cite{Choi:1998:FTD,
  Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  Low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) revealed, through the existence of $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$
order spots, a $c(2\times{}2)$ (chessboard-like) superstructure in the
plane of the film.

Three possible explanations were advanced for the $c(2\times{}2)$
superstructure \cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inter-diffusion of copper atoms through the cobalt layer may
  have led to the formation of a $MnCu$ surface alloy
  \cite{Wuttig:1993:MDB, Kraan:1995:GSS}.  However, these experiments
  were performed at room temperature, which is too cold to permit
  significant inter-diffusion through $6ML$ $Co$ \cite{Kief:1993:GST}.
  This suggestion was therefore ruled out.
\item The manganese may have had an internal $c(2\times{}2)$
  anti-ferromagnetic configuration.  However, the measured
  $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ spot intensity was $\sim 10$ times that
  predicted for magnetic diffraction of this type by Tamura et
  al.~\cite{Tamura:1988:DSA}.  This phenomenon is therefore incapable
  of providing a complete explanation of the observed superstructure.
\item An ordered $MnCo$ surface alloy may have been formed.  Given the
  evidence against the other two models, the observed diffraction
  pattern was attributed to $MnCo$ alloy formation.
\end{itemize}

Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements were taken by
colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory as part of the same project
\cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  The $[110]$
direction Kerr signal was seen to increase with the addition of
manganese, in the regime where the alloy exists.  The immediate
reaction to this is that the system's magnetic moment is increasing,
i.e. that the manganese atoms that are being added are
ferro-magnetically aligned, both with each other and with the cobalt.
However, the simultaneous drop in $[100]$ Kerr signal did not paint
the same picture, and it may be that a change in magneto-optical
response, rather than a genuine addition of magnetic moments, is
responsible for the increased $[110]$ signal.  The possibilities are
in particular need of investigation, given that a series
\cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS} of numerical calculations, using different
approximations, have produced widely differing predictions about the
magnetic properties of this system.

The polarization of a reflected electron beam from the sample surface
provides an alternative to MOKE, for measuring the magnetization,
through the difference, for the two electron spins, in density of
states at a particular energy created by the exchange splitting, and
as such provides an experiment which is interesting by virtue of
having an unpredictable result.  The experiments presented in this
thesis, using a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, are intended as an
intermediate stage on the way to similar measurements on
$MnCo/Co/Cu(001)$, although they could equally well lead to similar
measurements on other multi-layer structures of more direct industrial
relevance, such as metal/ferromagnet or semiconductor/ferromagnet spin
valves.  This possibility may help to address the conclusions,
concerning the motivation for experimental research projects, of
statistical research the author has presented elsewhere
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.

In addition, the measurements for $Co/Cu(001)$, in themselves, allow a
trial run of estimating the parameters in the new theory of this
chapter, and comparing a version of that theory, in which no Weiss
field affects the probing electrons, against another version, in which
an adjustable Weiss field affects the probing electrons.  This task is
undertaken in section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.

\part{Theory of Polarized Electron Reflection}
\label{per-theory}
\chapter[Theory]{Review of Published Theories, a New,
  Classical-Field Theory of Electron Waves as a Polarized Radiation
  Probe of Magnetic Surfaces, Comparison of These Theories with
  Published Experimental Data, and Motivation for New Experiments
  Presented Later in This Thesis}
\label{theoretical-context}

Theories of elastic spin-polarized electron scattering from a surface
can be classified by their underlying philosophy, which may be of
either a band-structure calculation or an analytical type, or by their
possession or otherwise of spatial variation of the scatterer, in the
plane of the surface.  This gives a total of four possible types of
theory:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}band-structure theories, with spatial variation of the
  scatterer; Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE} put forward a numerical
  method for undertaking calculations of this type, which would make
  quantitative predictions about the intensities and polarizations of
  reflected and diffracted beams, from a sample of a precisely
  specified atomic-scale structure, which, along with similar methods,
  has been applied to particular samples by a variety of workers
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Lind:1986:ETC,
    Lind:1987:SSA},
\item{}band-structure theories, without spatial variation of the
  scatterer; the method of Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE} can be applied
  in this way, but, as far as the author is aware, has not been,
  perhaps because ignoring the in-plane variation of the scatterer
  eliminates any possibility of examining diffraction orders other
  than the specular reflection,
\item{}analytical theories, with spatial variation of the scatterer;
  Darwin \cite{Darwin:1928:DME} produced a classical-field theory, in
  which an electron wave impinged on a sinusoidal electrostatic
  potential and magnetic flux density, whose lack of a Fourier
  component of zero in-plane wave-vector eliminated any possibility of
  examining the specular reflection, and
\item{}analytical theories, without spatial variation of the
  scatterer; the author produces a theory of this form, later in this
  chapter.  Its lack of any in-plane variation in the scatterer means
  that it is valid only for the specular reflection, not for other
  diffraction orders.
\end{enumerate}

Theories, of course, are refined (in the sense of choosing an atomic
configuration for a band-structure theory, or estimating the
parameters in an analytical theory,) and compared for their
correspondence to reality, by their ability to match experimental
results.  This is primarily an experimental thesis; in part
\ref{main-experiment}, some experimental polarized electron reflection
results, along with the means used to obtain them, are presented, and
in section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}, they are used to estimate
the parameters in the new theory presented in this chapter, and to
compare, for correspondence to reality, two versions of this theory,
in one of which the ferromagnetic samples exert a (statistically
significant) Weiss field on the incident electrons, and in the other
of which, they do not.

The only other theories mentioned above, which can be used to examine
a specular reflection, are that of Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE}, and
its close relatives, and some attention should be given to the match
between these theories and the experimental results of part
\ref{main-experiment}, and indeed the new theory of this chapter.  The
author has been unable to find an application of these theories to
specular reflection from a copper or cobalt surface, which would allow
direct, quantitative comparison with the experimental results,
although one might expect, in some rather ill-defined sense,
qualitative features in the specular reflections from other materials
to carry over to copper and cobalt.  This does not, however, prevent
direct comparison of Feder-type theories with the new theory presented
in this chapter, because the latter is not designed to be chemically
specific.

An important link between the band-structure theories and the new
theory presented in this chapter is that, in explaining the basis of
the numerical band-structure calculation, Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE}
appears to look forward to the day when the atomic-scale structure,
which is fed to the numerical method, can instead be encoded in the
continuous, adjustable parameters of an analytical theory, and
suggests electrostatic potential and magnetic flux density as
parameters for use in this fashion.  Where, in a theory based on these
parameters, the scatterer has mirror symmetry about the scattering
plane, as does the scatterer assumed in the new theory of this
chapter, this symmetry can \cite{Feder:1985:PTE} be combined with
time-reversal symmetry, to show that the reflected beam polarization,
for an unpolarized incident beam, is parallel to the magnetic flux
density, when the latter is either in the scattering plane, or
perpendicular to the scattering plane.  This provides two important
tests of the plausibility of any proposed emergent-phenomena theory;
the new theory presented in this chapter passes both tests.

Another such link is that a band-structure calculation has been
reviewed (figure \ref{copied-theory-figure}) \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP},
which appears to agree, to approximately the same standard of
precision that is possessed by relevant measurements, to be reviewed
in section \ref{experimental-context}, with the new theory presented
in this chapter, that at incident electron energies greater than
$\sim{}60\ut{eV}$, where the Taylor expansion allows the latter to
make quantitative predictions, the reflected beam polarization from a
nickel $(001)$ surface is independent of incident electron energy and
of angle of incidence.  Several other band-structure theories for
$Ni(001)$, with different atomic structures, have been reviewed
\cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP}, which have a lesser similarity to the new
theory of this chapter, and a correspondingly less good fit to
experimental data to be reviewed in section \ref{experimental-context}
\cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP}.

\label{copied-theory-figure}
\end{figure}

Striking differences between band-structure theories and the new
theory of this chapter are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}A band-structure theory has been reviewed
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} that predicts significant polarization (at
  some angles of incidence, more than $0.4$) of an $82\ut{eV}$
  electron beam, by reflection from a tungsten $(001)$ surface.  Since
  tungsten is not ferro-magnetic, the new theory of this chapter,
  because it ignores spin-orbit effects, predicts no polarization, yet
  it claims that $82\ut{eV}$ is within the region, of energies much
  less than the electron rest mass energy, where it is reasonable to
  ignore spin-orbit effects.  However, experiments to be reviewed in
  section \ref{experimental-context} suggest a way for both theories
  to survive this apparent contradiction between them, which will be
  discussed there.
\item{}The same band-structure calculation for tungsten predicts
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} a polarization, which changes its sign
  several times, as the angle of incidence $I$ is varied from $0$ to
  $30\ut{^{\circ}}$.  The new theory of this chapter predicts a
  polarization independent of $I$.
\item{}A band-structure calculation has been reviewed
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} that predicts significant polarization (up
  to $0.8$) of the reflected beam from tungsten $(001)$ in a few
  narrow ($\sim{}20\ut{eV}$) energy bands, while the new theory of
  this chapter predicts no polarization; however, the band-structure
  calculation does predict near-zero polarizations outside these
  bands.
\item{}A band-structure theory has been reviewed
  \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} that predicts significant polarization (at
  some scattering plane orientations, more than $0.8$) of an
  $60\ut{eV}$ electron beam, by reflection from a platinum $(111)$
  surface.  Since platinum is not ferro-magnetic, the new theory of
  this chapter, because it ignores spin-orbit effects, predicts no
  polarization, yet it claims that $60\ut{eV}$ is within the region,
  of energies much less than the electron rest mass energy, where it
  is reasonable to ignore spin-orbit effects.  However, experiments to
  be reviewed in section \ref{experimental-context} suggest a way for
  both theories to survive this apparent contradiction between them,
  which will be discussed there.
\item{}A band-structure theory has been reviewed
  \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP} that predicts a reflected polarization from
  an iron $(110)$ surface, which oscillates as the incident electron
  energy is varied, with an amplitude of $\sim{}0.1$.  This is rather
  different from the constant, possibly non-zero polarization
  predicted for this ferro-magnetic material by the new theory of this
  chapter.
\end{itemize}

\section[New Theory Introduction]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of
  Polarized Electron Reflection: Introduction}
\label{intro}

Having reviewed a number of published theoretical perspectives on
polarized electron reflection, and compared them against a promised,
new theory, it is now time to present that theory.

\subsection{Polarized Neutron Reflection}

Polarized neutron reflection, or PNR, is \cite{Blundell:1992:PNR,
  Blundell:1993:PNR} an established experimental technique for the
measurement of layer-dependent magnetization vector in magnetic
multi-layers.  A multi-layer structure is \cite{Blundell:1992:PNR,
  Blundell:1993:PNR} modelled as a series of steps in nuclear
potential and magnetic flux density.  The amplitude reflection
coefficient for neutron waves at each step is then calculated by
applying the usual \cite{Rae:1992:QM} boundary conditions to the
spin-up and spin-down wave-functions at the step, given the change in
wave-vector produced by the potential step.  The change in wave-vector
depends on the neutron's spin direction because of the torque exerted
upon the neutron magnetic moment, by the magnetic field.  Therefore,
the spin polarization of the reflected neutron beam, as a function of
incident beam energy, provides an indicator of the depth-resolved
magnetization profile of the sample.

\subsection{Polarized Electron Reflection}

Polarized electron reflection and diffraction are \cite{Lind:1986:ETC,
  Lind:1987:SSA} also established experimental techniques, for the
characterization of magnetic surfaces.  The measurement is identical
to PNR except for the substitution of electrons for neutrons, and the
unavailability \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} of the
Stern-Gerlach experiment, either for controlling the incident
polarization, or for measuring the reflected polarization.  The
Stern-Gerlach experiment is \cite{Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSA}
typically replaced by a Mott polarimeter \cite{Hodge:1979:MES,
  Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}, for measuring the reflected
polarization.  Electrons have significant advantages over neutrons for
this purpose: an electron beam can be produced using a device roughly
equivalent to a light-bulb filament, whereas a neutron beam is
typically produced using a nuclear reactor.  Also, the magnetic moment
of the electron is nearly two thousand times that of the neutron.

Despite the long-standing use of polarized electron reflection as an
experimental technique, as far as I'm aware, there has been no
attempt to develop a theoretical model of the process, along the lines
of that used for PNR, in order to interpret the results in terms of
the depth profile of the magnetization in the sample.  My intention
here is to produce an analysis of polarized electron reflection
similar to that of PNR by Blundell and Bland \cite{Blundell:1992:PNR,
  Blundell:1993:PNR}.  Section \ref{per-supplement} includes more
details of the derivations of equations, which are only sketched here.

  Polarized Electron Reflection: Amplitude Reflection Coefficient for
  an Electron Pure State, at a Single Step in Electric Potential and
  Magnetic Flux Density}

\caption{Reflection of an Electron Wave by a Single Step in Electric
Potential and Magnetic Flux Density}
\label{single_step}
\end{figure}
The first step in the analysis of reflection is to build a
potential-theory model of the sample, as a series of steps in electric
potential and magnetic flux density (figures \ref{dhatton1},
\ref{single_step}.)  The existence of sudden steps in magnetic flux
density follows \cite{Hammond:1997:EEI} from Maxwell's equations, for
an in-plane magnetization.  Shape anisotropy encourages
\cite{Johnson:1996:MAM, Hope:1997:SPR} the magnetizations of film
structures to be in-plane, and experiments confirm
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Krams:1992:MAU, Heinrich:1993:UMM,
Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} that the permanent magnetization in
$Co/Cu(001)$ is in-plane.  The existence of sudden steps in
electrostatic potential is supported by a comment in \emph{Calculated
Electronic Properties of Metals} \cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP}, although
this book is concerned primarily with bulk materials, and there is the
possibility that steps, which are sudden on the scale of bulk
materials, may be gradual on the scale of electron de Broglie
wavelengths.  I suspect that such a possibility would be easily
detectable in the experiments, because there would be no reflection
without a sudden potential step.

In reality, I expect the ``magnetic flux density'' part of the
potential not to be a genuine magnetic flux density, but a Weiss
field; in this paragraph, I will explain what the Weiss field is, and
why I expect it, rather than a genuine magnetic flux density, to
determine the behaviour of the electron beam.  The Weiss field is a
quantum-mechanical effect related to symmetry requirements on the
joint wave-function of a pair of electrons.  To illustrate the effect,
following loosely arguments in \emph{Solid State Physics}
\cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} and \emph{Quantum Physics}
\cite{Gasiorowicz:1996:QP}, consider two electrons, labelled $i = 1$
and $i = 2$, occupying two spatial states $|\psi_i>$ and $|\phi_i>$,
which are similar, atomic-orbital-like states, centred on two
neighbouring atomic sites, in a solid, and which also have possible
spin states $|\uparrow_i>$ and $|\downarrow_i>$.  It is a requirement
of quantum mechanics that the two electrons are indistinguishable from
one another; therefore, their joint spatial state cannot be a simple
state such as $|\psi_1>|\phi_2>$, which would identify a particular
electron as being on each atomic site.  To fulfil the
indistinguishableness requirement, the state must be such that the
only effect of exchanging the particle labels is to introduce a
uniform phase shift in the wave-function, i.e.~the joint spatial state
must be
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1>|\phi_2>+\exp{}(i\theta_A)|\psi_2>|\phi_1>)$,
where $\theta_A$ is the uniform phase shift in question.  Similarly,
indistinguishableness limits the joint spin states to
$|\uparrow_1>|\uparrow_2>$, $|\downarrow_1>|\downarrow_2>$, or
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow_1>|\downarrow_2>+\exp{}(i\theta_B)|\uparrow_2>|\downarrow_1>)$,
where $\theta_B$ is the uniform phase shift involved in particle
exchange due to the spin part of the wave-function alone.  Given that
electrons are fermions, quantum mechanics, further, demands that the
total phase shift on particle exchange, $\theta_A+\theta_B$, or simply
$\theta_A$, where no $\theta_B$ is involved in the spin wave-function,
is $\pi$.  One can identify the concept of the two electrons' spins
being parallel with the spin states where no $\theta_B$ is involved,
or where $\theta_B = 0$; therefore, when the electrons' spins are
parallel, $\theta_A = \pi$, and the joint spatial state is
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1>|\phi_2>-|\psi_2>|\phi_1>)$; this is an
odd function of the spatial displacement between the two electrons,
and must, therefore, vanish when this displacement is zero,
prohibiting the two electrons from being spatially coincident and,
providing that the wave-function varies smoothly with this
displacement, rendering the probability of them being very close
together low.  Given that there is an electrostatic repulsion between
the electrons, this is a low-energy state.  Similarly, one can
identify the concept of the two electrons' spins being anti-parallel
with the $\theta_B = \pi$ spin state, giving a joint spatial state
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1>|\phi_2>+|\psi_2>|\phi_1>)$; this even
function of the displacement between the two electrons does not
prevent the electrons from being very close together, or even
spatially coincident; their electrostatic repulsion, therefore,
renders it a high-energy state.  To summarize, the state in which the
electrons' spins are anti-parallel has a higher energy, by some amount
$\Delta{}V$, than the state in which their spins are parallel; it is
as if each electron's spin generates a magnetic flux density $B =
\frac{m_e\Delta{}V}{e\hbar}$, acting on the spin magnetic moment of
the other electron.  The Weiss field is this effective magnetic flux
density, produced by quantum-mechanical symmetry considerations,
scaled up to a situation where an electron interacts not just with one
other electron, but with the whole population of other electrons in a
solid.  I expect the Weiss field, not the genuine magnetic flux
density, to be the effect detected with the reflected electron beam,
because the Weiss field in transition metals is
\cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} roughly a factor of $100$ larger than the
genuine magnetic flux density in the remnant state; however, some
caution about this expectation is in order, because, as is clear from
the argument above, the spatial states of the electrons are crucial in
producing the Weiss field, and the spatial states of the unbound
electrons being reflected are very similar neither to the single-site
atomic orbitals described above, nor to the states of the transition
metals' $3d$ electrons, for which the factor of $100$ is known to hold
good.

It will be noted that, in the model, both the electrostatic potential
and the Weiss field are taken to be laterally homogeneous, i.e.~not to
vary with position in the plane of the film; this gives the appearance
of being a rather strong assumption about the configuration of the
magnetic film structure being studied.  In particular, it gives the
appearance of an implicit assumption of single-domain magnetization;
this is an assumption that has been made in other workers'
\cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF, Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP,
Bland:1998:ASE} explanations of the behaviour of $Co/Cu(001)$ film
structures, and which has \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} some justification
from Brillouin light scattering experiments; it is (section
\ref{bleargh}) also supported by magneto-optical Kerr effect
measurements.  In reality, the use of laterally homogeneous models
does not imply any assumption about the configuration of the film
structure or its domain structure; this study is concerned with the
specular reflection, which is the scattered beam, the in-plane
component of whose wave-vector is the same as the in-plane component
of wave-vector of the incident beam.  In the general theory of
scattering of matter waves by a potential, a scattered beam whose
in-plane wave-vector component differs from that of the incident beam
by $\vc{k}$ results from the Fourier component of the scattering
potential with in-plane wave-vector $\vc{k}$: specifically, the
specularly reflected beam results from the average value of the
potential, over the area of the sample covered by the incident beam,
and is unaffected by variations in the scattering potential, such as
domain structure, which are encoded in the Fourier components of the
scattering potential with non-zero in-plane wave vectors, the effects
of which appear only in the diffraction orders.  Of course, if there
are domains of varying magnetization directions, within the region
illuminated by the incident beam, then the average Weiss field
detected by polarized electron reflection will be smaller than the
saturation Weiss field within a single domain, but the situation is
still within the capability of this theory to handle.

Next, I need to discover the amplitude reflection coefficient, for a
pure, coherent, electron wave, at a single step (figure
\ref{single_step}.)  The incident and transmitted electron waves are
modelled as plane waves, with well-defined wave-vector components $p$
in the plane of the interface, and $q_i$ perpendicular to the
interface.  $p$ must be the same for all the waves, in order to
satisfy the boundary condition of continuity of the wave-function at
the interface.  Strictly, the eigen-states of a Hamiltonian which
includes a magnetic field are not plane waves; more about this later
(section \ref{incomplete}.)  The amplitude reflection coefficient is
\cite{Rae:1992:QM} this:
\begin{equation}
r_{01} = \frac{q_0-q_1}{q_0+q_1}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
or, for a general interface, this one:
\begin{equation}
r_{ij} = \frac{q_i-q_j}{q_i+q_j}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Next, I need to build an expression for the energy of the electrons.
There will be kinetic energy terms, along with an electrostatic
potential energy, and a term due to the torque, on the electron
magnetic moment, in a magnetic field \cite{Rae:1992:QM}. The form used
for this last term assumes a well-defined energy for all directions of
the electron spin.  Strictly, only certain spin directions are
eigen-states of a Hamiltonian that includes a magnetic field; more
about this later (section \ref{incomplete}.)  This leads to this
expression
\begin{equation}
q_i =
\left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}(1+x_i)^{1/2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for the perpendicular wave-vector component, where $I$ represents an
angle of incidence, and the potential energy terms are represented by
these dimensionless numbers:
\begin{equation}
\label{define-x}
x_i = y_i+z_i\cos{}S_i\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{define-y}
y_i = \frac{eV_i}{E\cos^2I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{define-z}
z_i = -\frac{e\hbar{}B_i}{2m_eE\cos^2I}\pnc{;}
\end{equation}
$S_i$ is the angle between the electron spin direction and the
magnetic flux density in region $i$, and $E_b$ is the total energy of
the incident electrons, and therefore, by conservation of energy, of
all the electrons.

I now use a binomial expansion \cite{Gallagher::MFH} for the case
where the potential energy terms are much smaller than the total
electron energy, where the dimensionless numbers I've just devised
are small.  The magnetic term associated with the Weiss field in a
ferromagnet is \cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP} a few tenths of an
electron-volt, and the electrostatic contact potentials in the metals
which I study will \cite{:2001:KPF, :2001:PTE} not be more than a few
volts, whereas, in my experimental set-up, the incident electron
energies range from a few hundred to a few thousand electron volts, so
this approximation seems reasonable.  With this expansion, the
amplitude reflection coefficient is this:
\begin{equation}
r_{ij} = \frac{1}{4}x_i-\frac{1}{4}x_j-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2-\frac{1}{8}x_ix_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\section[Reflection of an Unpolarized Beam]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of
  Polarized Electron Reflection: Reflection of an Unpolarized Beam
  from the Surface of a Bulk Magnetic Sample}
\label{bulk}

An unpolarized incident electron beam is \cite{Kessler:1976:PE,
  Kessler:1985:PE} an incoherent superposition of pure states
  representing all directions of the incident spin.  The polarization
  of the reflected beam from any surface is, therefore, given by an
  average of the polarization over all polarization directions,
  weighted according to the intensity reflection coefficient for each
  polarization.  This incoherent averaging process (section
  \ref{bulk-details}) gives this reflected polarization from a bulk
  surface (figure \ref{dhatton1})
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{polarization}
P & = & \frac{2y_1z_1}{3y_1^2+z_1^2}+O(\{y_1,z_1\})\br
& = &
-\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}+O(\{y_1,z_1\})\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}
Both the term given explicitly, and the next term in the binomial
expansion, are in the direction of the magnetic flux density in the
bulk material.  The polarization, predicted by this equation, is shown
as a function of Weiss field $B$, for a fixed electrostatic potential
$V= -0.9\ut{V}$, in figure \ref{display-cft-predictions}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\input{display-cft-predictions}}
\htmladdimg{./display-cft-predictions.png}
\caption{Predicted Reflected Beam Polarization against the Ratio of
  Weiss Field to Electric Potential, in the Sample}
\label{display-cft-predictions}
\end{figure}

The most salient qualitative feature of this polarization formula is
that, at high incident electron energies, the reflected polarization
is dominated by a non-zero term, which is independent of the incident
electron energy, and controlled by the balance between the
electrostatic potential and the magnetic flux density, in the sample.
This polarization can be as large as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ in either
direction.

\section[Multi-Layers]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of Polarized Electron
  Reflection: Multi-Layer Structures}
\label{multi}

\begin{figure}

\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{single-layer}}
\htmladdimg{./single-layer.png}
\caption{Reflection Paths for an Electron Wave in a Single Magnetic Layer}
\label{single-layer}
\end{figure}
I propose the extension of this analysis to magnetic multi-layer
structures, by using the theory of Fabry-Perot etalons, as is
\cite{Blundell:1992:PNR, Blundell:1993:PNR} already the practice in
PNR.  There are infinitely many possible paths for reflection from a
multi-layer structure, indexed by how many times the electron wave
``bounces'' within each layer.  In the diagram (figure
\ref{single-layer},) we can see paths with no bounces, with one
bounce, and with two bounces.  For a given, pure incident wave, the
reflected waves from the various paths are superposed coherently to
build the reflected wave, each term in the coherent superposition
including an amplitude factor due to the amplitude reflection or
transmission coefficient at each interface which it has encountered,
and a phase factor due to the path length which it has traversed in
the magnetic layers.  This will result in a spin-dependent amplitude
reflection coefficient for the whole multi-layer system, which will
provide the weightings to go into the incoherent superposition over an
unpolarized incident beam.  This incoherent superposition, as for the
bulk sample, will give the reflected polarization.  I expect working
through the maths for this to be trivial, but time-consuming.

\section[Comments]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of Polarized Electron
  Reflection: Comments on This Analysis}
\label{incomplete}

There follow comments on some assumptions in this analysis.  Firstly,
there is the matter of modelling the electrons as a plane wave.  This
is equivalent to neglecting the deflection of the electrons by the
Lorentz force, which means taking the limit of weak magnetic fields;
this limit has, in any case, been taken in the binomial expansion.
The same convention, of neglecting this deflection, was adopted by
Weber et al.  \cite{Weber:1999:EAF}, when they analysed the spin
polarization of transmitted electron waves.

Secondly, there is the issue of assuming that all electron spin
directions are eigen-states of the Hamiltonian.  In this, I depart
from the tradition of analysis of PNR, where matrices are
\cite{Blundell:1992:PNR, Blundell:1993:PNR} used to represent the
Zeeman energy, and the reflection coefficient, without any need for
this approximation.  I also depart from the work of Weber et al.
\cite{Weber:1999:EAF} on electron transmission: they regard the Larmor
precession, which is a manifestation of the fact that not all spin
directions are eigen-states of the Hamiltonian in a magnetic field, as
crucial in determining the transmitted polarization.  I propose the
production of a more ``first-principles'' model, which will use the
matrix representation of the reflection coefficients, and therefore
capture the Larmor precession, and other spin-flip scattering effects.
However, this model is not proposed as a replacement for the one
presented here, but as a complement to it.  What I suggest is to
subject both models, along with a third, completely classical,
reflection model (section \ref{fully-classical},) to experimental
data, and use the well-established \cite{MacKay:1992:BMA} methods of
Bayesian statistics, first to infer the parameters of magnetic flux
density, electric potential, and layer thickness, for each model, then
to judge the relative confidence that can be placed in each model.

One reason for not simply abandoning all but the most
``first-principles'' of the models is given by Anderson
\cite{Anderson:1972:MID}, who points out that any system, more
complicated than a molecule of approximately four atoms, is almost
never in an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, with the result that the
Schr\"odinger equation does not describe the state of the system.
This is because the tunnelling-like processes, which would otherwise
collapse the system into an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, are very
slow for complicated systems: often very slow compared with the age of
the universe, and certainly very slow compared with the rate of
occurrence of measurement-like interactions with the outside world,
which collapse the system into eigen-states of operators other than
the Hamiltonian.  Therefore, it can't be guaranteed that the model
that implements a Schr\"odinger equation with the most realistic
Hamiltonian will always be the most useful, in describing the real
behaviour of the system.

In addition, I have devised a very different argument
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} for not always preferring the most
first-principles model.

Thirdly, it is worthwhile to comment on the effect on the polarization
of transmitted waves, due to spin-dependent loss of electrons to
inelastic processes, which was noted by Weber et al.
\cite{Weber:1999:EAF}.  At first glance, the classical-field analysis
above appears to be entirely elastic.  However, it is capable of
assimilating the effect of these processes, which would appear as
imaginary parts in the electric potential and magnetic flux density.

\section[Conclusions]{A New, Classical-Field Theory of Polarized Electron
  Reflection: Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item The spin polarization of the reflected electron beam from a bulk
  magnetic surface, in the model described, is this:
\begin{equation}
\vc{P} = -\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1\vc{B_1}}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}+O(\{y_1,z_1\})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
\item{}The rate of electrons leaving the sample, in the reflected beam
(figure \ref{sd},) is, from integration of equation
\ref{reflected-amplitude},
\begin{equation}
\label{reflected-intensity}
G =
\left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{F}{e}$ is the rate of electrons arriving at the sample,
in the incident beam.
\item The extension of the model to multi-layer systems is likely to
  be a trivial, but time-consuming, mathematical task.
\item Two other, similar models are suggested, one of which differs
  from this by the use of a more ``first-principles'' treatment of the
  Zeeman energy, and the other, discussed in section
  \ref{fully-classical}, by a fully classical treatment of the
  reflection process, and
\item there is a strong case for retaining all three models, and using
  Bayesian statistics to compare them in the light of experimental
  data, rather than discarding all but the most ``first-principles''
  model.
\end{itemize}

Other workers have obtained theoretical predictions for reflected
electron beam polarizations, from magnetic and non-magnetic surfaces.
In chapter \ref{theoretical-context}, several of these were discussed,
and compared and contrasted with the theory of this chapter.

Before moving on to a completely classical version of this theory, an
aside is in order, on the angle-dependence of the intensity $G$ in
this theory, which has a fascinating $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$ form, in
terms of the angle of incidence $I$.  I have access to measurements,
of the currents\footnote{Strictly, being composed of electrons, these
currents are negative, but they are here presented as positive, for
greater ease of discussion; all the theoretical analysis has a sign
convention to match this.} $H_1$ and $H_2$ arriving at the Mott
polarimeter's two channeltrons after reflection, as a function of the
angle $\theta$, by which the sample is rotated about the scattering
plane normal, starting from an arbitrary (but permanently marked)
origin, made in conjunction with colleagues at the Cavendish
Laboratory, which I supposed may help to demonstrate this form.  The
incident electron beam energy and current, the potentials at the
polarimeter electrodes, and the translational position of the sample
were held constant throughout.

The original purpose of making these measurements was to find the
$\theta$ value, equivalent to $I = \frac{\pi}{4}$, for which the
centre of the reflected beam struck the centre of the polarimeter's
entrance hole.  This value of $\theta$ was expected to maximize $H_1$
and $H_2$.  The details of the functional forms of $H_1$ and $H_2$
away from this maximum are unknown, but a sensible guess is a
Gaussian,
\begin{equation}
H_i = H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{M^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right)+D_i\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
of which $H_i^{(0)}$, $\sigma_i$ and $D_i$ are adjustable parameters
representing the height and width of the maximum, and any additive
systematic error in the ammeter, respectively.  $M$ is the distance,
measured perpendicular to the ray direction of the reflected beam, by
which the centre of the reflected beam misses the centre of the
polarimeter's entrance hole.  $M \propto{}
\tan{}\left(I-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$, so
\begin{eqnarray}
H_i & = &
H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{tan^2\left(I-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2w_i^2}\right)+D_i\br
& = &
H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{tan^2\left(\theta_i^{(0)}-\theta-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2w_i^2}\right)+D_i\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
where $w_i$ is a re-scaled version of the width parameter $\sigma_i$,
$\theta_i^{(0)}$ is another adjustable parameter, representing the
arbitrary origin of the angle measurements, and the sign convention is
representative of the fact that the angles are measured in such a way
that increasing $\theta$ reduces $I$.  This is how one might expect
the system to behave, if the reflection coefficient is independent of
the angle of incidence.

If, on the other hand, the reflection coefficient depends on the angle
of incidence, in the way predicted by the theory presented above, one
obtains
\begin{equation}
H_i =
\frac{H_i^{(0)}\exp{}\left(-\frac{tan^2\left(\theta_i^{(0)}-\theta-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2w_i^2}\right)}{\cos^4(\theta_i^{(0)}-\theta)}+D_i\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
In figures \ref{angular-1} and \ref{angular-2}, the experimental data
are presented, along with best-fit versions, obtained by a
least-squares method, of both theories.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}

\caption{Current Arriving at Channeltron 1, against Rotation Angle of
  Sample; Points with Error Bars Show Experimental Results, and Lines

  $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$.}

  One with a Reflection Coefficient Proportional to
  $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$.}
\label{angular-2}
\end{figure}

The predictions of the two models are almost indistinguishable from
one another, and both are, therefore, about equally good fits to the
experimental data.  This is because the function $\frac{1}{\cos^4I}$
is characterized by sharp singularities at the most extreme possible
angles of incidence, the grazing incidence angles $I = -\frac{\pi}{2}$
and $I = \frac{\pi}{2}$, with a broad, flat intervening region.
Within this flat region where the experiments were undertaken, the
classical-field theory's reflection coefficient is, to a very good
approximation, independent of angle of incidence; therefore, it is
unsurprising that the predictions are indistinguishable from those of
a model with a reflection coefficient exactly independent of angle of
incidence.  There would be little point in attempting to extend the
experiment into the grazing angles of incidence, because, in this
region, the component of the electron motion perpendicular to the
sample surface is tiny, nullifying the classical-field theory's
fundamental assumption that the kinetic energy associated with this
component of the electron motion is much larger than the potential
energy step at the surface.  This also absolves us of the need to
worry about the ``un-physical'' singularities; they are, in any case,
outside the domain of validity of the theory.

The aside over, it is time to turn to a fully classical theory of
polarized electron reflection.

\section[Classical Theory]{A Completely Classical Polarized Electron
  Reflection Theory}
\label{fully-classical}

Above, (section \ref{conclusions},) I suggested that it might be
enlightening to develop a completely classical theory of polarized
electron reflection; this will be done in this section.  The classical
condition for reflection from a bulk sample is rather simple.  In
terms of the dimensionless numbers defined in equations
\ref{define-x}, \ref{define-y}, and \ref{define-z}, an electron is
reflected if
\begin{equation}
x_1 \geq{} 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and is not reflected if
\begin{equation}
x_1 < 1\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

This thesis is (section \ref{arc}) concerned with circumstances where
$|x_1| \ll{} 1$.  In this case, classical theory predicts a zero
intensity reflection coefficient.  Therefore, the measured reflections
presented in chapter \ref{results}, and those reviewed in section
\ref{experimental-context}, are purely quantum effects.

This does not imply that the classical theory is of no interest; an
important test of the plausibility of the quantum theory presented
earlier in this chapter is its obedience to Ehrenfest's theorem, which
states \cite{Gasiorowicz:1996:QP} that, when the wave-function varies
in space much more rapidly than the potential, the predictions of
classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are the same.

In this case, the potential includes a step.  Therefore, the
wave-function varies in space much more rapidly than the potential
only as the energy of the incident electrons tends to infinity.  In
this case, both classical theory, and the quantum theory presented
earlier in this chapter, predict a zero reflection coefficient, and
Ehrenfest's theorem is obeyed.

\section{Motivation for Experiments}
\label{motive}

Above, some theoretical perspectives have been presented, on polarized
electron reflection measurements of magnetic materials.  This section
details the motivation for undertaking the polarized electron
reflection measurements on a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, described in part
\ref{main-experiment}.

Colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory had earlier performed a series
of measurements on the system formed by growing a $0.5\ut{ML}$
$Mn/6\ut{ML}$ $Co/Cu(001)$ multi-layer \cite{Choi:1998:FTD,
  Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  Low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) revealed, through the existence of $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$
order spots, a $c(2\times{}2)$ (chessboard-like) superstructure in the
plane of the film.

Three possible explanations were advanced for the $c(2\times{}2)$
superstructure \cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inter-diffusion of copper atoms through the cobalt layer may
  have led to the formation of a $MnCu$ surface alloy
  \cite{Wuttig:1993:MDB, Kraan:1995:GSS}.  However, these experiments
  were performed at room temperature, which is too cold to permit
  significant inter-diffusion through $6ML$ $Co$ \cite{Kief:1993:GST}.
  This suggestion was therefore ruled out.
\item The manganese may have had an internal $c(2\times{}2)$
  anti-ferromagnetic configuration.  However, the measured
  $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ spot intensity was $\sim 10$ times that
  predicted for magnetic diffraction of this type by Tamura et
  al.~\cite{Tamura:1988:DSA}.  This phenomenon is therefore incapable
  of providing a complete explanation of the observed superstructure.
\item An ordered $MnCo$ surface alloy may have been formed.  Given the
  evidence against the other two models, the observed diffraction
  pattern was attributed to $MnCo$ alloy formation.
\end{itemize}

Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements were taken by
colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory as part of the same project
\cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  The $[110]$
direction Kerr signal was seen to increase with the addition of
manganese, in the regime where the alloy exists.  The immediate
reaction to this is that the system's magnetic moment is increasing,
i.e. that the manganese atoms that are being added are
ferro-magnetically aligned, both with each other and with the cobalt.
However, the simultaneous drop in $[100]$ Kerr signal did not paint
the same picture, and it may be that a change in magneto-optical
response, rather than a genuine addition of magnetic moments, is
responsible for the increased $[110]$ signal.  The possibilities are
in particular need of investigation, given that a series
\cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS} of numerical calculations, using different
approximations, have produced widely differing predictions about the
magnetic properties of this system.

The polarization of a reflected electron beam from the sample surface
provides an alternative to MOKE, for measuring the magnetization,
through the difference, for the two electron spins, in density of
states at a particular energy created by the exchange splitting, and
as such provides an experiment which is interesting by virtue of
having an unpredictable result.  The experiments presented in this
thesis, using a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, are intended as an
intermediate stage on the way to similar measurements on
$MnCo/Co/Cu(001)$, although they could equally well lead to similar
measurements on other multi-layer structures of more direct industrial
relevance, such as metal/ferromagnet or semiconductor/ferromagnet spin
valves.  This possibility may help to address the conclusions,
concerning the motivation for experimental research projects, of
statistical research the author has presented elsewhere
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.

In addition, the measurements for $Co/Cu(001)$, in themselves, allow a
trial run of estimating the parameters in the new theory of this
chapter, and comparing a version of that theory, in which no Weiss
field affects the probing electrons, against another version, in which
an adjustable Weiss field affects the probing electrons.  This task is
undertaken in section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.

$Co/Cu(001)$ is a much-studied system.  Before discussing previously
published experimental polarized electron reflection results, and
presenting the new, polarized electron reflection experiment, which is
at the heart of this thesis, it will be as well to review other
workers' published results on the structure and magnetic properties of
this system.

\section[Literature Review]{Review of Published Information on the
  Structure and Magnetic Properties of $Co/Cu(001)$}
\label{bleargh}

Although bulk cobalt is \cite{Taylor:1963:CDM} a hexagonal close
packed metal at room temperature and pressure, thin cobalt films,
grown by molecular beam epitaxy on $Cu(001)$, adopt
\cite{Smardz:1990:RTF, Schmid:1993:FIT, Ramsperger:1996:GSF} the
face-centred cubic structure of the copper; this epitaxial structure
requires \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} some elastic strain in the cobalt, and
breaks down \cite{Weber:1996:SRM, Bland:1998:ASE} for large
thicknesses\footnote{In this section, the common convention of giving
thicknesses in mono-layers is followed, whereas elsewhere in this
thesis, thicknesses are given in units related to the metre.  From
comments in ``Magnetic Anisotropies of Ultrathin $Co(001)$ Films on
$Cu(001)$'' \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}, one can calculate that, for
$Co/Cu(001)$, $1\ut{ML} = (166\pm{}36)\ut{pm}$, whereas other workers
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:OMA, Weber:1996:SRM} state that
$1\ut{ML} \approx{} 180\ut{pm}$.}, as it becomes energetically
favourable to form dislocations to relieve the strain; the boundary of
``large thicknesses'' is \cite{Heinrich:1993:UMM} not thinner than
$10\ut{ML}$, and has been found \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} to vary between
$10\ut{ML}$ and $20\ut{ML}$, depending on the temperature at which the
film is deposited, although, at room temperature, substantial strain
remains \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} up to at least $40\ut{ML}$, and the
method used to measure the lattice parameter, and therefore the
strain, \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} suggests that the cobalt remains
face-centred cubic throughout; therefore, one would expect all but the
thinnest of the $Co$ films studied in this thesis, and possibly the
thinnest one as well, to be in the r\'egime where epitaxial growth has
begun to break down, in the sense of the lattice parameter departing
from that of copper.  For thicknesses greater than $1\ut{ML}$
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Smardz:1990:RTF, Ramsperger:1996:GSF} or
$2\ut{ML}$ \cite{Heinrich:1993:UMM, Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP,
Bland:1998:ASE}, and less than $10\ut{ML}$ \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF}, the
cobalt wets \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Smardz:1990:RTF,
Schmid:1993:FIT, Heinrich:1993:UMM, Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} the surface, growing
layer-by-layer, although this is not \cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF} the
case for $(1\,1\,17)$ mis-cut substrates.  The surface roughness of
the cobalt film, therefore, oscillates \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} as a
function of film thickness, with period $1\ut{ML}$.

Thin cobalt films on copper $(001)$ have a ferro-magnetic phase, for
(relatively) large thicknesses; the transition thickness $d_C$ has
been variously reported as being $1.75\ut{ML}$ at room temperature
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU}, as having a lower limit of $0.7\ut{ML}$ and
an upper limit of $(0.96\pm{}0.1)\ut{ML}$ \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF}, as
being $(1.6\pm{}0.3)\ut{ML}$ at room temperature
\cite{Krams:1992:MAU}. as being $(1.3\pm{}0.3)\ut{ML}$
\cite{Schumann:1994:PFP}, as being approximately $1.5\ut{ML}$
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO}, as being $(1.35\pm{}0.35)\ut{ML}$
\cite{Buckley:1996:VMP}, and as having a a lower limit of $1\ut{ML}$
and an upper limit of $1.7\ut{ML}$ \cite{Bland:1999:ASE}.  Where the
films are thin enough to be regarded as two-dimensional, the
ferro-magnetism cannot \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} be rendered stable by the
Weiss field alone, and some other effect, perhaps due to dipole-dipole
interactions or magnetic anisotropy, must \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} be
invoked to explain the ferro-magnetism.  For thicknesses slightly
greater than the critical thickness, the Curie temperature is
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} much lower than that for bulk cobalt, and
exhibits \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} a strong dependence on the film
thickness, varying \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} approximately linearly
from $125\ut{K}$ at $1.5\ut{ML}$ thickness to $575\ut{K}$ at
$3\ut{ML}$ thickness, compared with a bulk Curie temperature reported
as $1388\ut{K}$ \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} or $1392\ut{K}$
\cite{Wijn:1991:MPM}; imperfections in the film can
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} further suppress the Curie temperature.  The
magnetic susceptibility as a function of thickness obeys
\cite{Bland:1998:ASE} a power law consistent with ferro-magnetism
arising through a two-dimensional percolation transition; that is to
say, the susceptibility $\chi$, for thicknesses $d < d_C$, is
\cite{Schumann:1994:PFP} proportional to
$\left(1-\frac{d}{d_C}\right)^{-\gamma}$: two separate experiments
found \cite{Schumann:1994:PFP} $\gamma{} = 2.41\pm{}0.07$ and
$\gamma{} = 2.38\pm{}0.07$, which are \cite{Schumann:1994:PFP}
consistent with the theoretical prediction of $\gamma{} = 2.389$, for
a two-dimensional percolation phase transition, but rather less
consistent with the prediction of $\gamma{} = 1.66$, for a
three-dimensional percolation phase transition.  A percolation phase
transition occurs \cite{Schumann:1994:PFP}, as material (cobalt) is
added, when the concentration of atoms becomes sufficient for the
(short-range) exchange interaction to be transmitted throughout the
sample.

The magnetic anisotropy energy of $Co/Cu(001)$ films combines a
uni-axial term, which includes \cite{Heinrich:1993:UMM} an important
(but controversial \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}) contribution from epitaxial
strain, and which constrains \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Krams:1992:MAU,
Heinrich:1993:UMM, Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} the magnetization
to be in the plane of the film, i.e.~which renders in-plane
magnetization energetically favourable by \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}
$(920\pm{}180)\ut{\mu{}J}\ut{m}^{-2}$ of film surface area, with a
term of fourfold symmetry within the plane, favouring
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Heinrich:1993:UMM, Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP} magnetization along $<110>$ axes
within the plane of the film, over magnetization along $<100>$ axes
within the plane of the film, by $(55\pm{}3.75)\ut{kJ}\ut{m}^{-3}$ of
cobalt volume, less $(15.5\pm{}1.5)\ut{\mu{}J}\ut{m}^{-2}$ of film
surface area; however, the fact that the remnant magnetization along
$[110]$ is \cite{Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} smaller than the
saturation magnetization has been interpreted \cite{Weber:1996:MIO,
Weber:1996:OMA, Buckley:1996:VMP}, on the assumption, which is
\cite{Krams:1992:MAU} supported by Brillouin light scattering
measurements, of single-domain magnetization during the reversal
process (Stoner-Wohlfarth reversal,) along with other features
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO} of the shape of the $M$-$H$ loops, to mean that
the overall easy axes of the film depart \cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Buckley:1996:VMP} from $<110>$ due to an additional term, of twofold
symmetry within the plane of the film; this departure has
\cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF, Weber:1996:MIO, Buckley:1996:VMP,
Bland:1998:ASE} been attributed to the effect of atomic steps on the
$Co$ surfaces, inherited from the pre-deposition $Cu$
surface\footnote{It is important to distinguish between this residual
roughness of an annealed substrate surface, and the much greater
roughness of as-sputtered substrates, which has been cited
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU} as responsible for un-reproducible magnetic
properties in epitaxial films.}; the $1\ut{ML}$-period oscillation in
the surface roughness, as a function of film thickness, is
\cite{Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:SRM, Bland:1998:ASE} matched by an
oscillation of the same period in this twofold-symmetric anisotropy
within the plane, as revealed \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} by the variation
of the coercive field with thickness; the oscillation of the coercive
field with thickness is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} superimposed on a
general increase in coercive field with increasing thickness, which
undergoes \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} a sudden change of slope at thickness
$2\ut{ML}$.  However, other workers \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} have
questioned the existence of the twofold-symmetric anisotropy within
the plane.  Any corresponding oscillation in the fourfold-symmetric
anisotropy within the plane is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} smaller than
$5\%$ of the average anisotropy.  Others \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU}
have also noted modification of the coercivity and other features of
the in-plane anisotropy, due to imperfections of the film.  However,
the possibility has also been acknowledged \cite{Bland:1998:ASE} that
the step edges suppress the remnant magnetization along $[110]$ not by
altering the film's magnetic anisotropy, but by acting as domain-wall
pinning sites, in a multi-domain structure, and scanning tunnelling
microscopy has revealed a surface topography around the steps, whose
shape anisotropy is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} not sufficient, of itself,
to explain the observed anisotropy oscillations, requiring the
invocation of either lattice distortion at the step edges and
magnetostriction, or anisotropic diffusion of cobalt atoms at the
steps; the former is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:SRM} supported
by electron diffraction measurements.  It could \cite{Weber:1996:MIO,
Weber:1996:OMA}, alternatively, be that the oscillation of magnetic
anisotropy with thickness results from an oscillation, with thickness,
in the spin-orbit interactions of the discrete states, forced on
electrons by confinement in a square potential well, formed by the
cobalt film's lower and upper surfaces; however, unlike the
surface-topography-based explanation, there is \cite{Weber:1996:MIO}
no independent evidence that this spin-orbit coupling varies with the
same, $1\ut{ML}$, period as the magnetic anisotropy.  As film
thickness is reduced to very small values, the magnetic anisotropy
vanishes \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}, at the same thickness where the film
ceases to be ferro-magnetic, supporting the idea that it is magnetic
anisotropy that stabilizes the ferro-magnetic state.  There is
\cite{Bland:1998:ASE} also a change in magnetic anisotropy when the
epitaxial structure starts to break down at large thicknesses; to be
more specific, when the epitaxial strain starts to be relieved with
increasing thickness, at \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} $\sim{}16\ut{ML}$, the
easy axes of the twofold-symmetric, in-plane anisotropy suddenly
rotate \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} through ninety degrees, and its magnitude
sharply increases \cite{Weber:1996:SRM}, while, simultaneously, the
magnitude of the coercive field sharply increases
\cite{Weber:1996:SRM}, although this has been interpreted
\cite{Weber:1996:SRM} as the effect of dislocations acting as domain
wall pinning sites, in a multi-domain structure, rather than as a
corresponding, sharp increase in the magnitude of the
fourfold-symmetric, in-plane anisotropy.  The amplitude of the
magnetic anisotropy energy is manifested in the coercive field, which
has been given \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} as
$(6.4\pm{}1.1)\ut{kA}\ut{m}^{-1}$; this depends
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Bland:1998:ASE, Bland:1999:ASE} on
temperature, in a way which is attributed \cite{Schneider:1990:CTU,
Bland:1998:ASE, Bland:1999:ASE} to diffusion of copper atoms through
the cobalt film at elevated temperatures.  The twofold-symmetric
anisotropy within the plane can \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} also be altered
by growing the film in an applied magnetic field.

The saturation magnetizations of $Co/Cu(001)$ films, of all
thicknesses where the films are ferro-magnetic, are
\cite{Krams:1992:MAU, Weber:1996:SRM} within $5\%$ of the
$1.424\ut{MA}\ut{m}^{-1}$ \cite{Krams:1992:MAU, Weber:1996:SRM}
saturation magnetization of bulk cobalt.  The saturation magnetization
increases \cite{Weber:1996:MIO} with increasing film thickness.

It will be enlightening to recapitulate what this literature review
has revealed about two key questions.  Firstly, are the relatively
thick (between $(2.57\pm{}0.36)\ut{nm}$ and $(17.1\pm{}2.4)\ut{nm}$,
i.e.~between $\sim{}15\ut{ML}$ and $\sim{}100\ut{ML}$) cobalt films
used for the new experimental study, presented in this thesis, really
epitaxial?  The literature \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} reveals that only the
thinnest one of these seven films has the possibility of being
perfectly epitaxial, in the sense of adopting both the face-centred
cubic structure of the copper substrate and the copper lattice
parameter; the same paper reveals that the one further film with a
thickness below $40\ut{ML}$ ($6.6\ut{nm}$) will still be epitaxial in
the sense of having a face-centred cubic structure, but will have a
lattice parameter somewhere between the strain-free lattice parameters
of copper and cobalt.  The literature does not provide any direct
information on the structure of the five thicker films, but the
intuitive extrapolation is that the trend of remaining face-centred
cubic, but having a lattice parameter that gradually approaches the
strain-free lattice parameter of cobalt, will continue as the
thickness increases beyond $40\ut{ML}$.  Certainly, all the low-energy
electron diffraction patterns from $Co/Cu(001)$, which the present
author (sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction with colleagues) has
observed, have been characteristic of a face-centred cubic structure,
but the thickest of the films we examined in this way was
$(1.5\pm{}0.26)\ut{nm} \approx{} 9\ut{ML}$, and therefore sheds little
light on this discussion.

Secondly, what is the magnetic easy axis of the films?  It seems
\cite{Schneider:1990:CTU, Krams:1992:MAU, Heinrich:1993:UMM,
Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} certain to be in-plane, but where
within the plane?  Other workers \cite{Ramsperger:1996:GSF,
Weber:1996:MIO, Weber:1996:OMA, Buckley:1996:VMP, Bland:1998:ASE} have
found the easy axis to depart from the $<110>$ directions favoured by
the fourfold-symmetric anisotropy, in a way that is controlled by the
detailed surface topography of the substrate, and which, therefore,
varies from sample to sample.  The copper substrate crystal used in
the experiments herein presented was the same one that was used in
``Variations in the magnetic properties of ultrathin $Co$ films due to
the adsorption of non-magnetic metal atoms at the $Co$/vacuum
interface'' \cite{Buckley:1996:VMP}, where the easy axis of the cobalt
films was found to be $[100]$.  For this reason, the sample was
magnetized, and the reflected electron beam polarization measured,
along $[100]$, in the experiments herein presented.  However, there is
some cause for caution: the substrate crystal has been polished since
the published results on its easy axis were obtained, and those
published results were obtained at rather smaller cobalt thicknesses
than those used herein, whereas it is \cite{Weber:1996:SRM,
Bland:1998:ASE} possible for the easy axis direction to vary with
thickness.  Therefore, the most useful guide to the easy axis
direction is likely to be provided by $B$-$H$ loops for films in the
relevant thickness range, measured using the magneto-optical Kerr
effect (MOKE,) by one of the author's colleagues, using a rig
developed jointly by the author and colleagues, during a polarized
electron reflection experiment (section \ref{july-2002-experiments},)
conducted jointly by the author and the colleague in question.  These
loops are shown in figure \ref{moke}.  Two features of the loops for
non-zero thicknesses are crucial.  Firstly, the remnant magnetization
along $[100]$ is almost as large as the saturation magnetization,
confirming both that there is a minimum of the magnetic anisotropy
energy, with respect to magnetization direction, when the
magnetization is along $[100]$, and that the remnant state of the
cobalt film is almost single-domain.  Secondly, the magnetization
appears to reverse all at once, rather than in multiple steps,
suggesting that this energy minimum is the global minimum,
i.e.~$[100]$ is \emph{the} easy axis.

Having summarized the present state of knowledge concerning
$Co/Cu(001)$, it is time to review some published polarized electron
reflection studies.

\section[The Experimental Context]{Other Workers' Published
  Experimental Data on the Spin Polarization of Reflected Electron
  Beams}
\label{experimental-context}

Although the author is familiar with several examples
\cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP,
Kirschner:1985:IES, Landolt:1985:SPS, Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG,
Lind:1987:SSA, Smardz:1990:RTF, Weber:1999:EAF} of published data,
obtained using Mott polarimeters, on the spin polarization of
reflected, diffracted, transmitted, inelastic, and secondary electron
beams, from magnetic and non-magnetic materials, rather few of them
\cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP,
Smardz:1990:RTF} concern specular reflection.  Unfortunately, these
include only one \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF} of the publications, in which
copper \cite{Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG, Lind:1987:SSA,
Smardz:1990:RTF} or cobalt \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF, Weber:1999:EAF}
samples are used.  Nevertheless, other workers' specular reflection
experiments on metallic surfaces can be compared, at least
qualitatively, with the new theory of this chapter, and with the
published theories reviewed in this chapter.

Measurements of reflected beam polarization from a tungsten $(001)$
surface, as a function of incident electron energy and angle of
incidence, have been reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP}.  No error
estimates are given\footnote{However, some idea can be obtained from
the level of reproducibility between different laboratories.},
rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of theories
quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, it is easy to imagine
that the random errors are large enough that, except in some narrow
($\sim{}20\ut{eV}$,) resonance-like energy bands, the measurements are
consistent with the energy-independent, angle-independent, zero
polarization predicted in the new theory of this chapter.  One of the
narrow energy bands includes $82\ut{eV}$, allowing the measurements to
be simultaneously consistent with the band-structure calculation for
tungsten, mentioned earlier in this chapter.  It could be conjectured
that the narrow energy bands correspond to changes in wave-vector on
reflection, which, in some sense, match the repeat distance of those
parts of the atomic cores, which are of sufficiently deep potential to
render the electrons' kinetic energy comparable with their rest mass
energy, allowing spin-orbit polarizing effects to become significant,
and removing these narrow energy bands from the domain of validity of
the new theory in this chapter.  Some of the published band-structure
calculations, reviewed earlier in this chapter, appear to have
captured phenomena of this type.

Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a $Cu_3Au$ $(001)$ surface, as a function of
incident beam energy, at an angle of incidence of $13\ut{^{\circ}}$.
In the energy region above $\sim{}60\ut{eV}$, where the Taylor
expansion allows the new theory of this chapter to make quantitative
predictions, the measurements appear to tend rapidly with increasing
incident energy, to the constant, zero polarization of this theory.

The same paper \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} goes on to review measurements
of reflected beam polarization from a nickel $(001)$ surface, as a
function of incident beam energy and angle of incidence, as does
another paper \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP} in the same collection.  For
the former data set, in the energy region above $\sim{}60\ut{eV}$,
where the Taylor expansion allows the new theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context} to make quantitative predictions, the
measurements provide a very good match to the constant polarization
this theory.  However, they provide an approximately equally good
match to the relevant, published band-structure calculation, reviewed
earlier in this chapter.  For philosophical reasons explained
elsewhere \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, the author is inclined to assign a
higher prior probability to the new theory of this chapter than to the
band-structure theory, leading to the former being preferred in this
case of roughly equal goodness of fit.  However, prior probabilities
are \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} subjective, and readers are, therefore,
fully entitled to disagree.  The latter data set, which uses an
estimator of the polarization designed to reveal only exchange
effects, not spin-orbit effects, is a rather better match to the
constant polarization, predicted by the new theory of this chapter,
than to any of several band-structure theories, reviewed in that
chapter.

Measurements of reflected beam polarization from an iron $(110)$
surface, as a function of incident electron energy and angle of
incidence, have been reviewed \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP}.  No error
estimates are given\footnote{However, some idea can be obtained from
the level of reproducibility between different laboratories.},
rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of theories
quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, it is easy to imagine
that the random errors are large enough that the measurements are
consistent with the energy-independent, angle-independent, possibly
non-zero polarization predicted in the new theory of this chapter.
However, the relevant band-structure theories, reviewed earlier in
this chapter, provide approximately an equally good fit.

\label{copied-experiment-figure}
\end{figure}

Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a platinum $(111)$ surface, as a function of
the orientation of the scattering plane, relative to the crystal axes,
at an incident electron energy of $60\ut{eV}$, and an angle of
incidence of $43.5\ut{^{\circ}}$.  Again, no error estimates are
given, rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of
theories quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, visually,
the results appear to provide a superb match to the predictions of a
band-structure calculation for this material, reviewed earlier in this
chapter \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP}, and a very dubious match to the zero
polarization predicted by the new theory of this chapter.  Because the
measurements were all taken at the same beam energy, the conjecture
above, regarding narrow energy bands that are outside the domain of
validity of the new theory in this chapter, might apply.

Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a gold $(110)$ surface, as a function of angle
of incidence and temperature, at an incident electron energy of
$50\ut{eV}$.  Once again, no error estimates are given, rendering it
impossible to judge the relative merits of theories quantitatively, by
these measurements.  However, it does appear that there are
substantial polarizations (up to $0.6$,) which vary with angle of
incidence.  At energies as low as $50\ut{eV}$, the lowest-order Taylor
expansion in the inverse energy, which is used in the new theory of
this chapter, is becoming dubious, and it is therefore not clear what
this theory predicts, but if the Taylor expansion were valid, it would
predict zero polarizations for all angles of incidence.  Because the
measurements were all taken at the same beam energy, the conjecture
above, regarding narrow energy bands that are outside the domain of
validity of the new theory in this chapter, might apply.

Since the bulk of this thesis was completed, the author has also
become aware of published experimental data \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF} on
the spin polarization of a reflected electron beam from a $Co/Cu(001)$
film; the experiment was undertaken at a incident electron energy of
$17\ut{eV}$, and for a range of thicknesses up to $\sim{}2.5\ut{ML}$;
the intention was to detect the onset of ferro-magnetism with
increasing thickness.  Both the thicknesses and the beam energy are
considerably lower than those studied in the new experiments presented
in this thesis; therefore, the results are not directly comparable.
At the onset of ferro-magnetism, a jump was observed from a spin
polarization of zero to an ``asymmetry'' of $\sim{}0.19$.  It is not
clear whether this ``asymmetry'' represents an absolute polarization,
or whether it requires calibration with something akin to a detector
Sherman function.

\section[Repeated Adaptation List]{List of Adaptations to the
  Polarimeter, and to the Measurement Technique, from \emph{Mott
    Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory} \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}}
\label{repeated-adaptation-list}

Mott polarimetry involves substantial technical difficulties.  There
follows a list of difficulties that were encountered with the
Cavendish polarimeter, and measures that were taken to overcome them,
in order to allow the experiments described in this thesis to proceed.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Significant cross-talk was discovered between the signal output
  cables on the two channeltrons; this was largely eliminated by the
  installation of improved shielding within the polarimeter.
\item{}The high voltage supply used to accelerate the electrons toward
  the thorium target was found to be unreliable; there was a
  considerable delay in the diagnosis of this fault due to the
  difficulty of finding a reasonably safe means of measuring the
  required potential difference of many $\ut{kV}$.  Once the supply
  had been discovered to be producing only $750\ut{V}$, replacement of
  the offending control potentiometer was rapidly effected.
\item{}The channeltrons are \cite{::CEM} designed as single-electron
  counting devices, intended to function by using an electrostatic
  field to accelerate an incoming electron into a collision, which
  liberates further electrons from the channeltron walls, which are in
  turn accelerated to produce further collisions.  This process
  amplifies a single electron into a current pulse containing
  $\sim{}10^8$ electrons, which is readily detectable using a digital
  counter.  However, the count rates measured by this method were
  found to be anomalously low.  This is believed to be because the
  rate, at which electrons were arriving at the channeltrons, was
  substantially above the saturation rate ($\sim{}10^4\ut{Hz}$,) at
  which the channeltrons' detection efficiency begins to drop rapidly
  with increasing electron arrival rate.  This was the case with
  specularly reflected beams of energies between $\sim{}2\ut{keV}$ and
  $\sim{} 3\ut{keV}$ from magnetic and non-magnetic surfaces, even for
  the smallest incident beam currents available.  Therefore, it was
  necessary to make adaptations to allow the use of the front ends of
  the channeltrons as Faraday cups, the current collected at which
  could be measured as a continuous flow, rather than as discrete
  electron arrival events.  To this end, an ammeter of sufficient
  sensitivity to measure the currents involved (of order $1pA$) was
  procured, and a wire which connected the front ends of the two
  channeltrons, possibly allowing flow of current between them, was
  removed.
\item With the high voltage supply to the thorium foil in operation,
  continuous current measurement revealed current spikes, occurring at
  a frequency of $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$, peaking at what later transpired to
  be approximately the steady current, which was obtained in
  successful measurements.  The spikes were set against a background
  of substantially lower current, and were also detected as pulses in
  single electron counting mode, whether or not an accelerating
  potential difference was applied across the channeltrons.  This is
  now believed to have been a consequence of the electrical connection
  to the thorium foil and surrounding assembly from outside the vacuum
  chamber having some freedom of movement inside its insulating
  casing, leading to a situation in which there was good electrical
  contact only for brief periods, occurring at $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$,
  producing the spikes that represented the current in the intended
  operating condition.  The effect has disappeared since the
  mechanical security of the connection was improved.
\item Calculation of raw asymmetries
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},+} = \frac{f_{+,1}-f_{+,2}}{f_{+,1}+f_{+,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},-} = \frac{f_{-,1}-f_{-,2}}{f_{-,1}+f_{-,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
from the measurements \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} on the reflected beam
from $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ shows larger uncertainties, and slightly
poorer consistency between the two runs of the experiment than the
results from the use of the formula (equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}) for the elimination of
multiplicative systematic errors, suggesting that the multiplicative
errors do exist, and were subject to drift over the period between the
two runs of the experiment, and that the use of the formula, with the
polarization reversal achieved using opposite remanent magnetization
directions of the film structure, was a necessary measure.
\item The difficulty of adjusting the zero on the ammeter used for
  continuous current measurements, given its slow response both to the
  zeroing control and to changes in the current which it was
  measuring, led to a suspicion that there might be additive offsets
  which would require a fitting procedure of the kind introduced in
  \emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
  \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  The non-zero and variable values obtained
  for the channeltron currents at zero incident beam current, using
  this procedure, indicate that such offsets do exist, and are subject
  to drift; therefore, both the fitting procedure and the time
  ordering of the experiments were necessary precautions.
\end{itemize}

Earlier, when this chapter's new, classical-field theory of polarized
electron reflection was outlined, it was promised that the full
algebraic details of that theory would follow.  These are presented in
the next section.

\subsection[Amplitude Reflection Coefficient]{Amplitude Reflection
  Coefficient for an Electron Pure State, at a Single Step in Electric
  Potential and Magnetic Flux Density}

The incident and transmitted electron waves are modelled (figure
\ref{single_step}) as plane waves, allowing the well-defined
wave-vector components $p$ in the plane of the interface, and $q_i$
perpendicular to the interface.  $p$ must be the same for all the
waves, in order to satisfy the boundary condition of continuity of the
wave-function at the interface.  The amplitude reflection coefficient
is \cite{Rae:1992:QM}
\begin{equation}
r_{01} = \frac{q_0-q_1}{q_0+q_1}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
or, for a general interface,
\begin{equation}
r_{ij} = \frac{q_i-q_j}{q_i+q_j}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Next, I need to build an expression for the energy of the electrons.
There will be kinetic energy terms, which, in the non-relativistic
limit, are
\[
\frac{\hbar^2p^2}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\]
and
\[
\frac{\hbar^2q_i^2}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\]
along with an electrostatic potential energy
\[
-eV_i\pnc{,}
\]
and a term due to the torque, on the electron magnetic moment, in a
magnetic field \cite{Rae:1992:QM}
\[
\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\]
where $S_i$ is the angle between the electron spin and the magnetic
flux density.  The form of this last term assumes a well-defined
energy for all values of $S_i$.  Strictly, only certain $S_i$ values
are eigen-states of a Hamiltonian which includes a magnetic field;
more about this later (section \ref{incomplete}.)  The total energy is
\begin{equation}
E =
\frac{\hbar^2p^2}{2m_e}+\frac{\hbar^2q_i^2}{2m_e}-eV_i+\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_e}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
or, where $p$ is expressed as a fraction $\sin{}I$ of the total wave-number
in the absence of any potential, $I$ being an angle of incidence like
that in figure \ref{dhatton1},
\begin{equation}
E = E\sin^2I+\frac{\hbar^2q_i^2}{2m_e}-eV_i+\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_e}
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
\Rightarrow{}q_i & = &
\left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}\left(1+\frac{eV_i}{E\cos^2I}-\frac{e\hbar{}B_i\cos{}S_i}{2m_eE\cos^2I}\right)^{1/2}\br
& = & \left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}(1+x_i)^{1/2}\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x_i = y_i+z_i\cos{}S_i$, $y_i = \frac{eV_i}{E\cos^2I}$, and
$z_i = -\frac{e\hbar{}B_i}{2m_eE\cos^2I}$.

I now use a binomial expansion \cite{Gallagher::MFH} for the case
where the potential energy terms are much smaller than the total
electron energy, where the dimensionless numbers I've just devised
are small.  The magnetic term associated with the Weiss field in a
ferromagnet is \cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP} a few tenths of an
electron-volt, and the electrostatic contact potentials in the metals
which I study will not be more than a few volts, whereas, in my
experimental set-up, the incident electron energies range from a few
hundred to a few thousand electron volts, so this approximation seems
reasonable.
\begin{eqnarray}
q_i & = & \left(\frac{2m_eE\cos^2I}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1/2}\left(1+\frac{1}{2}x_i-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2+O(x_i^3)\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

The amplitude reflection coefficient is, therefore,
\begin{eqnarray}
r_{ij} & = &
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x_i-\frac{1}{2}x_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)\br
& & \times\left(1+\frac{1}{4}x_i+\frac{1}{4}x_j-\frac{1}{16}x_i^2-\frac{1}{16}x_j^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)^{-1}\br
& = &
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x_i-\frac{1}{2}x_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)\br
& & \times\left(1-\frac{1}{4}x_i-\frac{1}{4}x_j+\frac{1}{8}x_i^2+\frac{1}{8}x_ix_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)\br
& = &
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x_i-\frac{1}{2}x_j-\frac{1}{4}x_i^2-\frac{1}{4}x_ix_j+\frac{1}{4}x_j^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\right)\br
& = & \frac{1}{4}x_i-\frac{1}{4}x_j-\frac{1}{8}x_i^2-\frac{1}{8}x_ix_j+\frac{1}{8}x_j^2+O(\{x_i,x_j\}^3)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection[Unpolarized Beam]{Reflection of an Unpolarized Beam from the
  Surface of a Bulk Magnetic Sample}
\label{bulk-details}

An unpolarized incident electron beam is \cite{Kessler:1976:PE,
  Kessler:1985:PE} an incoherent superposition of pure states
  representing all directions of the incident spin.  Each such
  direction can be represented by its spherical polar angle
  co-ordinates $(\theta{},\phi{})$.  That is to say, the incident beam
  contains a flux of electrons
\begin{equation}
F_1\td{\theta}\td{\phi} = A\sin\theta\td{\theta}\td{\phi}
\end{equation}
with polarization direction between $\theta$ and
$\theta{}+\td{\theta}$, and between $\phi$ and $\phi{}+\td{\phi}$.
The flux of such electrons in the reflected beam will, therefore, be
\begin{equation}
\label{reflected-amplitude}
F_2\td{\theta}\td{\phi} = |r_{ij}|^2F_1\td{\theta}\td{\phi}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The reflection from the surface of a bulk sample is to be modelled as
a single reflection, of amplitude reflection coefficient $r_{01}$, in
a situation where $V_0$, $B_0$, and therefore $x_0$, are all zero.  In
this case,
\begin{equation}
r_{01} = -\frac{1}{4}x_1+\frac{1}{8}x_1^2+O(x_1^3)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
|r_{01}|^2 = \frac{1}{16}x_1^2-\frac{1}{16}x_1^3+O(x_1^4)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
assuming that $r_{01}$ is real.

If the spherical polar representation $(\theta_i,\phi_i)$ is used for
the direction of the magnetic flux density in region $i$, then
\begin{equation}
\cos{}S_i = \sin\theta_i\cos\phi_i\sin\theta\cos\phi{}+\sin\theta_i\sin\phi_i\sin\theta\sin\phi{}+\cos\theta_i\cos\theta\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
x_i = y_i+z_i(\sin\theta_i\cos\phi_i\sin\theta\cos\phi{}+\sin\theta_i\sin\phi_i\sin\theta\sin\phi{}+\cos\theta_i\cos\theta{})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The polarization of the pure state represented by $(\theta{},\phi{})$,
in the Cartesian co-ordinate system associated with this spherical
polar system, is
\begin{equation}
\vc{P}(\theta{},\phi{}) =
(\sin\theta\cos\phi{},\sin\theta\sin\phi{},\cos\theta{})\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and the average polarization of the reflected beam is
\begin{eqnarray}
\vc{P} & = &
\frac{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}\vc{P}(\theta{},\phi{})F_2\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}F_2\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}\br
& = &
\frac{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}(\sin\theta\cos\phi{},\sin\theta\sin\phi{},\cos\theta{})|r_{01}|^2F_1\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}|r_{01}|^2F_1\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}\br
& = &
\frac{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}(\sin\theta\cos\phi{},\sin\theta\sin\phi{},\cos\theta{})\left(\frac{1}{16}x_1^2-\frac{1}{16}x_1^3+O(x_1^4)\right)\sin\theta\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}{\int_{\theta{}=0}^{\pi}\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}\left(\frac{1}{16}x_1^2-\frac{1}{16}x_1^3+O(x_1^4)\right)\sin\theta\td{\theta}\td{\phi}}\br
& = & \frac{(I_2-I_6,I_3-I_7,I_4-I_8)+O(\{y_1,z_1\}^4)}{I_1-I_5+O(\{y_1,z_1\}^4)}\pnc{.}

  Polarimeter}
\label{compact}

\section{Theoretical Physics of Mott Polarimetry}

Mott polarimetry is a means of measuring the spin polarization of an
electron beam, and finds its most frequent application in
photo-emission spectroscopy \cite{Heinzmann:1990:} and the study of
surfaces, thin films and multi-layers \cite{Mulhollan:1992:LDS}.  The
latter is the application with which this thesis is primarily
concerned.  Mott polarimeters are based on the left-right asymmetry in
the scattering of polarized electrons by atoms, i.e. the relative
difference in scattering cross-section between scattering events
through the same angle in opposite senses (equation \ref{xsec},) and
its use as an indicator of the incident beam's spin polarization
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Common choices of scatterer for Mott
polarimeters are gold, thorium and uranium foils \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP}.  All of these have high proton numbers $Z$,
leading to a large spin-dependent potential correction (equation
\ref{spinorb}.)  Thorium and uranium provide a value of total
scattering cross-section $\sigma _0$ (equation \ref{xsec}) which is
around $15\%{}$ greater than that for gold \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP} and an analysing power $S$ (equation \ref{xsec})
which is improved by between $10\%{}$ and $20\%{}$
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP} or even as much as $30\%{}$
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP}.  On the other hand, thorium and uranium have the
disadvantage that their chemical reactivity renders them more
sensitive than gold to atmospheric contaminants, which may reduce both
overall cross-section and Sherman function (section \ref{crosssec})
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  For the polarimeter used in
this project, a thorium foil has been chosen (figure \ref{sd}.)

\subsection{The Spin-Dependence of the Scattering Potential}
\label{so}

The differential cross-section as a function of scattering angle in
Mott scattering, i.e.  the scattering of electrons by nuclei at small
impact parameters, exhibits a dependence on the electron spin
direction \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  As Kessler
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} points out, in addition to
simplifying the potential calculation, the use of small impact
parameters, i.e. high energies and large scattering angles, increases
the analysing power of the polarimeter, as a result of the
$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}$ dependence of the spin-orbit correction
(equation \ref{spinorb}.)  The mechanism for this can be understood
classically, as the additional, position-dependent term in the
scattering potential, resulting from the torque exerted on the
electron's spin magnetic moment, by the magnetic field due to the
presence of a moving, charged nucleus in the electron's rest frame
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Gay \& Dunning
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP} and Dunning \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP} have developed
a quantitative version of this model for a single scattering nucleus,
which results in the expression for the spin-dependent potential
contribution
\begin{equation}
\label{spinorb}
V_{so}'=\frac{Ze\mu _B\mathbf{L}.\mathbf{S}}{8\pi\epsilon _0\hbar
m_ec^2|\mathbf{r}|^3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is the proton number of the nucleus, $\mu _B$ is the Bohr
magneton, $\mathbf{L}$ is the orbital and $\mathbf{S}$ the spin
angular momentum of the electron, in the rest frame of the nucleus,
and $\mathbf{r}$ is the displacement of the electron from the nucleus.
This potential form is equivalent to the fine splitting by the
spin-orbit interaction familiar from the analysis of bound electronic
states in atomic physics \cite{Gasiorowicz:1996:QP}.  Kessler
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} also makes some helpful
comments on this model.

\subsection[Cross-Section]{Spin-Dependence of the Scattering Cross-Section}
\label{crosssec}

By subjecting the general solution of the Dirac equation for a central
potential to the condition that the electron wave-function is a
superposition of a plane incident wave with a spherical (in wavefront
geometry, not necessarily in the symmetry of the scattered amplitude)
scattered wave, Kessler \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} finds it
possible to express the effect of a spin-dependent potential
correction on the scattering cross-section $\sigma $ (whether
differential or integrated over a particular solid angle) as
\begin{equation}
\label{xsec}
\sigma =\sigma _0(1+SP)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma _0$ and $S$ are functions of the incident electron
energy $E_b$, and of the scattering angle $\theta $, and $P$ is the
component of the spin polarization of the incident beam along the
normal to the scattering plane; that is to say, if the electrons were
forced to collapse into states of well-defined spin component along
this direction, the fractions with spin up $f_u$ and spin down $f_d$
would be such that
\begin{equation}
\label{polar}
P=f_u-f_d\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
$S$ is known as the asymmetry function \cite{Sherman:1956:CSR,
  Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}, the Sherman function
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE, Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP} or the analysing power \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP,
  Bertacco:1999:NES}.  The only assumption about the form of the
potential that was required to obtain this result was its separability
in spherical polar co-ordinates.  All the finer details of the
potential, be it that of a single atom (section \ref{so}) or that of a
metal foil of the kind found in a real polarimeter (figure \ref{sd},)
are contained in the functional forms of $\sigma _0$ and $S$.  In
particular, if there were no mechanism, of the kind described in
equation \ref{spinorb}, for spin-dependence in the scattering
potential, then $S$ would vanish.

Equation \ref{xsec} leads directly to the left-right asymmetry in
scattering of a polarized electron beam.  Two detectors are so placed
as to collect scattered electron beams with scattering angles of the
same magnitude, but in opposite senses (figure \ref{sd}.)  The
scattering plane normals for the two detectors are therefore in
opposite directions, i.e. the polarization component $P$ is of the
same magnitude but opposite sign at the two detectors.  For a
scatterer of even quite low symmetry, $S$ will be the same for both
detectors, with the result that the rates of electron arrival at the
two detectors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, will be \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
Dunning:1994:MEP}, from equation \ref{xsec}
\begin{equation}
\label{r1}
R_1 = R_0(1+SP)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{r2}
R_2 = R_0(1-SP)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
In the case of the compact retarding-potential polarimeter (figure
\ref{sd}, chapter \ref{compact},) it is possible to obtain $S$ for
some values of the energy of the incident electrons at the target and
the energy window defined by the retarding potential from look-up
tables \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}.  Combining equations \ref{r1} and
\ref{r2}, the polarization is
\begin{equation}
\label{asymmean}
P = \frac{R_1-R_2}{S(R_1+R_2)}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\section{The Instrument at the Cavendish Laboratory}

A Mott polarimeter has been available at the Cavendish Laboratory for
some time.  The main purpose of the polarimetry project to date has
been to increase its reliability as a measuring device to the point
where it can be used to determine the polarization of a reflected,
diffracted or secondary electron beam from an ultra-thin magnetic film
structure.  The latter has now been achieved using a specularly
reflected electron beam from a film structure that previous research
has suggested is of interest (chapter \ref{motive}.)  This has
required the finding of technical solutions to a variety of
instrumental difficulties \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} (sections
\ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)

The polarimeter now in use at the Cavendish Laboratory is of the
compact, retarding-potential type (figure \ref{sd})
\cite{Zhang:1991:LEE, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  The detector position is
chosen because there is a broad maximum in the Sherman function $S$,
defined above, for metal foils at a scattering angle of around
$120^{\circ}$ \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Electrons are focused onto the
thorium target by the electrostatic grids and lenses at the front of
the device (figure \ref{sd},) and are accelerated to energies between
$20\ut{keV}$ and $25\ut{keV}$, suitable for the required low impact
parameter scattering, by an electrostatic potential applied at the
thorium foil \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  An electrostatic potential
applied at the retarding grids (figure \ref{sd}) turns back electrons
which have lost more than some specified amount of energy, chosen by
setting the retarding grid potential, during the scattering process
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This eliminates a large proportion of
multiply scattered electrons, for which the Sherman function $S$ is
reduced, without the reduction in the total cross-section $\sigma _0$,
which is brought about by using a thin film target to reduce multiple
scattering \cite{Dunning:1987:UTG}.
\begin{figure}

  Polarimeter, $a$ the Fraction of Those Electrons that Are Accepted
  into the Polarimeter, and $H_i$ the Rate at which Electrons Are
  Scattered towards Channeltron $i$.}
\label{sd}
\end{figure}

The use of a retarding potential also means that the external
electrodes can all be kept grounded, with the obviation of the need
for bulky shielding on the detector as well as the direct safety
benefits \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This, coupled with the relatively
small target potential of $\sim{}22\ut{kV}$, which restricts the
inter-electrode distances needed to avoid electrical breakdown, keeps
the instrument small (the distance between the two channeltrons is
$\sim{}10\ut{cm}$) \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}, which is convenient for
its attachment to a vacuum chamber (chapter \ref{chamber-chapter}) for
experiments and for development and maintenance.  In addition, the
closeness of the channeltrons to the target, and the large solid angle
which they therefore subtend, allows for a high total scattering
cross-section $\sigma_0$ (equation \ref{xsec})
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  The relatively low energy of electrons
incident on the thorium foil (figure \ref{sd}) also increases $\sigma
_0$.

\subsection{The Channeltron}

The nature of the channeltron is presented in figure \ref{channeltron}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{channeltron}}
\htmladdimg{./channeltron.png}
\caption{A Channeltron}
\label{channeltron}
\end{figure}
The functioning of the device in electron-counting mode is described
in detail in its manual \cite{::CEM}.  It can also be operated in a
continuous current measurement mode, with a small, positive collector
voltage and a sensitive ammeter connected to its front end.

An electron source is also needed for the experiments; for this, a
commercial electron gun is used.  The experiments in section
\ref{method} and section \ref{july-2002-experiments} used a temporary
replacement electron gun, since the gun that had been used for the
experiments in section \ref{autumn-2001-experiments} had
malfunctioned.  An unfortunate consequence of a slight geometrical
incompatibility, between the temporary replacement electron gun and
the vacuum chamber (chapter \ref{chamber-chapter},) was that
low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy
measurements were not possible, while the temporary gun was in place;
it was therefore necessary to rely on previous calibrations (sections
\ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{auger-maths},) for the kind of
information that these techniques would have produced.

Both the temporary replacement electron gun, and the gun procured by
the author's predecessors, are described in detail in their respective
manuals \cite{:1997:UME, :1978:LAE}.

The Mott polarimeter is an unusual, and relatively novel, instrument,
and with its measurements are associated particular systematic errors;
there follow descriptions of these, and of some established
experimental and mathematical techniques for eliminating them.

\section{Systematic Errors Specific to Mott Polarimetry}
\label{specific}

Gay and Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP} identify two sources of systematic
error unique to Mott polarimeters:
\begin{itemize}
\item The incoming electron beam may be misaligned (figure
\ref{misalign}.)
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{misalign}}
\htmladdimg{./misalign.png}
\caption{A Misaligned Incident Electron Beam.  Based on a diagram by
Gay \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP}}
\label{misalign}
\end{figure}
\item The two detectors may have efficiencies $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$,
which are less than unity.  More crucially for asymmetry measurements
(equation \ref{asymmean},) it may be that $\eta_1\neq\eta_2$.
\end{itemize}

Gay \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP} show that each of these effects
introduces a multiplicative relative systematic error in the electron
arrival rate at one channeltron compared with that at the other, which
invalidates the use of the raw asymmetry as a polarization indicator
(equation \ref{asymmean}.)  A technique has been developed
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP} which allows the elimination of
a systematic error of this nature.  In this scenario, the rates of
electron arrival $R_{ij}$ on channeltrons $i=1$ and $i=2$ for beams of
polarizations of equal magnitude $|P|$, in opposite directions
$j=\uparrow{}$ and $j=\downarrow{}$.  The polarization is then
given\footnote{In real experiments, the values of $R_{1\uparrow}$,
  $R_{1\downarrow}$, $R_{2\uparrow}$, and $R_{2\downarrow}$ are not
  perfectly specified, but are subject to significant random errors.
  In this case, the polarization obtained from equation \ref{rev}
  becomes an estimator; a given measurement will provide a
  polarization value, via the formula, which will not always be equal
  to the true value of the polarization, but whose value will be drawn
  from some probability distribution
  $P(P_{\textrm{formula}}|P_{\textrm{true}})$ about the true value.
  Frequentist statisticians might wish to ask whether it is an
  unbiased estimator, i.e.~whether the expectation of this probability
  distribution is equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$.  An answer could be
  particularly difficult to derive, given the non-linearity of
  $P_{\textrm{formula}}$ in the directly measured electron arrival
  rates.  Bayesian statisticians might prefer to abandon the
  estimator, and think in terms of the simpler forward probability
  distribution
  $P(R_{1\uparrow},R_{1\downarrow},R_{2\uparrow},R_{2\downarrow}|R_0,P_{\textrm{true}})$,
  using Bayes' theorem to invert it to
  $P(R_0,P_{\textrm{true}}|R_{1\uparrow},R_{1\downarrow},R_{2\uparrow},R_{2\downarrow})$}
by \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}
\begin{equation}
\label{rev}
P =
\frac{\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}-\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}}}{S(\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}+\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}})}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Derivation and Explanation of Equation \ref{rev}}
\label{explain}

Why would one expect this formula to work?  The underlying principle
is the time-honoured one of making two measurements, in which the
systematic error is of the same magnitude, but in opposite senses,
then taking an average of the two measurements, to obtain a result
free of systematic error.  However, because the systematic errors
under consideration here are multiplicative, rather than additive,
``average'' indicates geometric mean, rather than arithmetic mean.
The application of this principle in the present case will now be
examined in greater detail.

Let $\eta_i$ be the sensitivity (quantum efficiency) of detector $i$.
The two sources of multiplicative systematic error mentioned above can
be defined as conditions where $\eta_1 \neq{} \eta_2$, and where
$\td{s} \neq{} 0$, where the misalignment $\td{s}$ is as defined in
figure \ref{misalign}.  The measured electron arrival rate at detector
$i$, with incident polarization direction $j$, $R_{ij}$, is
\begin{equation}
R_{ij} = \eta_iQ_{ij}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $Q_{ij}$ is the actual rate at which electrons arrive at the
detector.

Let $\Theta_i$ be the solid angle subtended by detector $i$ at the point
where the electron beam strikes the thorium foil.  The scattering
probability per unit solid angle in the region of detector $1$ is
(equation \ref{r1}) $\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})$ for polarization
direction $\uparrow{}$, and $\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})$ for
polarization direction $\downarrow{}$, and vice versa (equation
\ref{r2}) in the region of detector $2$, i.e., if $Q_0$ is the rate at
which electrons are incident on the thorium foil,
\begin{equation}
Q_{1\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Q_{1\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Q_{2\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
Q_{2\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
R_{1\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\eta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{1\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_1\eta_1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{2\uparrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\eta_2\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
R_{2\downarrow} = Q_0\sigma_0(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})\Theta_2\eta_2\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

If $A$ is the
cross-sectional area of a detector,
\begin{eqnarray}
\Theta_1 & = & \frac{A}{r_1^2}\br
& = & \frac{A}{(s+\td{s})^2+h^2}\br
& = & \frac{A}{s^2+h^2}\left(1+\frac{2s\td{s}+\td{s}^2}{s^2+h^2}\right)^{-1}\br
& \approx{} & \frac{A}{s^2+h^2}\left(1-\frac{2s\td{s}}{s^2+h^2}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
where $|\td{s}| \ll{} \frac{1}{2s(s^2+h^2)}$.  Similarly,
\begin{equation}
\Theta_2 \approx{}
\frac{A}{s^2+h^2}\left(1+\frac{2s\td{s}}{s^2+h^2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Some cumbersome notation can be avoided by defining $\Theta_0 =
\frac{A}{s^2+h^2}$ and $\td{\Theta} =\frac{2s\Theta_0\td{s}}{s^2+h^2}$.
Then
\begin{equation}
\Theta_1 = \Theta_0-\td{\Theta}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\Theta_2 = \Theta_0+\td{\Theta}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The polarization obtained from equation \ref{rev}, in the absence of
random errors, is therefore,
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\textrm{formula}} & = &
\frac{\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}-\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}}}{S(\sqrt{R_{1\uparrow}R_{2\downarrow}}+\sqrt{R_{1\downarrow}R_{2\uparrow}})}\br
& = &
\left(\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right.\br
& &
\left.-\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right)\br
& &
/\left(\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1+SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right.\br
& & \left.+\sqrt{Q_0^2\sigma_0^2(1-SP_{\textrm{true}})^2\eta_1\eta_2(\Theta_0+\td{\Theta})(\Theta_0-\td{\Theta})}\right)\br
& = & P_{true}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Additive Offsets}
\label{add}

Some systematic errors, instead of taking the form of a constant ratio
of measurements to true values, take the form of a constant difference
between measurements and true values; these systematic errors are
additive, not multiplicative.  During the experiments presented in
this thesis, the apparent electron arrival rates (chapter
\ref{results}) at the detectors, with the electron gun switched off,
and the conditions otherwise the same as in the real experiments, were
occasionally checked.  These rates should indicate the size of any
additive systematic error.  They were found to be of the order of
$1\ut{Hz}$, which is much smaller than the measured rates with the
electron gun on.  Additive systematic errors are, therefore, not
believed to be significant here.

\section{Drift Effects}

An empirically-based discussion of the possible effects of drift, in
the experiments presented in this thesis, can be found in section
\ref{july-2002-experiments}.  The measures taken to counter these
effects are discussed in section \ref{per-1-film}, and appendices
\ref{per-1-direction}, and \ref{per-1-channeltron}.

The technological principles of the vacuum maintenance equipment are
described in detail in \emph{Ultrahigh Vacuum Practice}
\cite{Weston:1985:UVP}, with useful additional information in ``vacuum
technology'' \cite{:1999:VT}.  The central portion of the vacuum
chamber, in which the sample holder (figure \ref{holder}) is situated,
is \cite{Hope:1997:SPR} constructed from $\mu$-metal, in order to
screen out external magnetic fields, while most of the peripheral
portions are constructed from stainless steel.  During the experiment
described in part \ref{main-experiment}, the chamber, and associated
equipment, maintained the gas pressure to which the sample was
exposed, at all times other than during argon ion sputtering, below
$(22\pm{}0.29)\times{}10^{-9}\ut{mbar}$, with a base pressure of
$(140\pm{}2.9)\times{}10^{-12}\ut{mbar}$.

There follow more detailed descriptions of the apparatus for sample
preparation, attached to the vacuum chamber.

\section{Sample Holder}
\label{holder-section}
The copper crystal, which forms the basis of the samples, is held in
the vacuum chamber (figures \ref{chamber-pumps}, \ref{chamber-prep})
on a sample holder (figure \ref{holder}.)
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics{holder}}
\htmladdimg{./holder.png}
\caption{The Sample Holder}
\label{holder}
\end{figure}
This sample holder provides the facility for moving the sample, with
two rotational degrees of freedom, and three translational degrees of
freedom.  It also provides heating for the sample, by means of the
power developed when a current is passed through the finite Ohmic
resistance of the heating wires, and measurement of the temperature of
the sample, and of a point slightly removed in space from the sample,
by means of the two thermocouples.

\section{Argon Ion Sputtering Gun}
\label{igs}

The chamber (figure \ref{chamber-prep}) contains an argon ion
sputtering gun, for use in cleaning the surface of the copper crystal.
The principles of this device are shown in figure \ref{igf}.
\begin{figure}
\latex{\includegraphics{igf}}
\htmladdimg{./igf.png}
\caption{Schematic Diagram of the Argon Ion Sputtering Gun}
\label{igf}
\end{figure}
The argon ion beam has a cleaning effect on the sample surface by
removing a surface layer.  The surface layer removal proceeds
\cite{Luntz:1999:RTE} by surface atoms and molecules, which are struck
by argon ions, recoiling into the bulk of the sample.  The elastic
response of the bulk of the sample then expels the surface atoms and
molecules.

As well as removing surface impurities, the author expects the
sputtering process to have removed the surface layer of amorphous
copper, which is \cite{Bowden:1967:FL} likely to have formed during
the polishing of the surface that took place, when the copper crystal
was temporarily removed from the vacuum chamber, between the
experiments in section \ref{autumn-2001-experiments} and those in
section \ref{july-2002-experiments}.

The gun was purchased commercially by the author's predecessors, and
is described in more detail in its manual \cite{:1991:OIA}.

\section{Electron-Beam Evaporators}
\label{evaporators}

Three electron-beam evaporators, for depositing cobalt, manganese, and
copper on the sample, are present in the vacuum chamber (figure
\ref{chamber-prep}.) Figure \ref{mn-evap-figure} shows the manganese
evaporator.
\begin{figure}
\latex{\includegraphics{mn-evap-figure}}
\htmladdimg{./mn-evap-figure.png}
\caption{Schematic Diagram of the Manganese Evaporator}
\label{mn-evap-figure}
\end{figure}
This was chosen as the example evaporator, because the author is more
familiar with it than with the other two, having dismantled it to
replace the manganese charge and the cathode filament.

The heat generated by the current flowing in the cathode filament
excites electrons to leave the filament.  These are accelerated, by
the electric field, into the manganese (or cobalt or copper) charge,
where their kinetic energy is deposited as heat.  This evaporates some
of the manganese, producing a gas of manganese atoms and ions.  Those
that effuse from the exit hole are all travelling in roughly the same
direction, and therefore form an atom beam, which, if it strikes the
sample surface, deposits \cite{Wells:2001:TFM} a film of manganese on
that surface.

The manganese and copper evaporators were both constructed by the
author's predecessors, and are of very similar design.  The cobalt
evaporator, while working on the same principle, was purchased
commercially by the author's predecessors, and has the important
addition of a current collector, near its exit hole, which measures
the flux of ions, and therefore of atoms, leaving the exit hole.  This
is taken to be a measurement of the rate of cobalt deposition on the
sample.

The cobalt evaporator is described in more detail in its manual
\cite{:1992:IMU}.

Having described the vacuum chamber, and associated sample preparation
equipment, it is now time to present the methods by which this
equipment was used, in the experiments whose results are presented
later in this thesis.

\section{Method}
\label{method}

The purpose of this procedure is to measure the intensity and
polarization of the specularly reflected electron beam from
$Co/Cu(001)$, as a function of cobalt thickness, incident electron
energy, and incident electron beam current.  This description of the
procedure has been constructed in a modular way, in the sense that a
broad-brush view of the procedure is given, with references to later
sections, which give finer details of each step; there are several
levels of detail.  This section has been constructed in this unusual
fashion, because the author, aware of the general view that best
practice in computer programming is to arrange the instructions, which
describe what is to be done, in this fashion, is keen to investigate
whether the same principle applies to natural-language descriptions of
what has been done.  Some of the very fine details are to be found in
an appendix (appendix \ref{very-fine-method}.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The one of the two rotational motion drivers (section
  \ref{holder-section},) which had a horizontal axis of rotation,
  perpendicular to the surface of the $(001)$ copper crystal, was used
  to orient the $[100]$ axis of the crystal vertically within
  $5^{\circ}$, using visual inspection and a previous identification,
  by low-energy electron diffraction, of the orientation of the
  crystalline axes relative to the crystal's cut faces.
\item{}The $(001)$ copper crystal (section \ref{holder-section},) was
  cleaned in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (figure \ref{chamber-prep},)
  according to the procedure in section \ref{cleanup}, eight times.
  The reasons for choosing eight as the number of cycles are discussed
  in section \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}.  The resulting clean,
  well-ordered copper surface was named ``substrate 9,'' to continue
  the numbering sequence used in preliminary experiments (sections
  \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements were conducted,
  according to the procedure in section \ref{per-1-film}.
\item{}Cobalt was added to the sample, and the resulting film
  subjected to a series of polarized electron reflection measurements,
  according to the procedure in section \ref{grow-and-measure}, seven
  times.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Procedure for Cleaning the $Cu(001)$ Surface}
\label{cleanup}

The purpose of this procedure is to produce a sample surface which is
free of contaminants, and has a well-ordered crystalline structure.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The vacuum chamber's ion pump (figure \ref{chamber-pumps}) was
  isolated from the chamber using a gate valve, and switched off, to
  protect the pump from saturation with argon.
\item{}The sample was placed, according to the procedure in appendix
  \ref{place-sample}, in a position which had previously been
  determined as being in the
  path of the ion beam from a commercial argon ion sputtering gun
  (section \ref{igs},) with the sample's exposed $(001)$ face toward
  the gun.
\item{}The ion energy from the ion gun was set to
  $(2.8\pm{}0.029)\ut{keV}$.
\item{}The gas inlet valve of the ion gun was opened until the
  pressure in the chamber, as revealed by the ion gauge (figure
  \ref{chamber-pumps},) was $(875\pm{}110)\ut{pbar}$.
\item{}On some occasions, a visual check was made for a blue glow at
  the sample surface, which would confirm that the ion beam was
  reaching the surface.
\item{}The sputtering process was allowed to continue for
  $(59\pm{}9)\ut{minutes}$.
\item{}The gas inlet valve of the ion gun was closed.
\item{}The power supply that provided the ion energy was switched off.
\item{}When the pressure in the chamber, as revealed by the ion gauge
  (figure \ref{chamber-pumps},) had dropped to less than $1\ut{pbar}$,
  the ion pump was switched on.
\item{}The valve between the ion pump and the chamber was opened, and
  the ion pump was switched on.
\item{}A current of $(8.75\pm{}0.04)\ut{A}$, through the sample
  heating filament (figure \ref{holder},) was switched on.
\item{}When the sample temperature, as revealed by the sample
  thermocouple, exceeded $773\ut{K}$, the current through the sample
  heating filament was switched off.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[Growth and Measurement]{Procedure for Adding Cobalt to the
  Sample Surface and Conducting Polarized Electron Reflection
  Measurements}
\label{grow-and-measure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The sample was placed, according to the procedure in appendix
  \ref{place-sample}, in a position that had previously been
  determined, by observation of the resulting film with Auger electron
  spectroscopy \cite{Linsmeier:1994:AES, Linsmeier:1994:AESa,
  Childs:1995:HAE} (sections \ref{autumn-2001-experiments},
  \ref{auger-maths}), to lead to cobalt adsorption from a commercial
  electron-beam evaporator (section \ref{evaporators}), with respect
  to the translational dimensions, and $180^{\circ}$ from that
  position, with respect to rotation about a vertical axis.
\item{}The cobalt evaporator was switched on, and adjusted to give a
  flux monitor current $I_{mon}$ of $\sim{}30\ut{nA}$; a value of
  $I_{mon}$ with a quantitative precision estimate was recorded.
\item{}The sample was placed, according to the procedure in appendix
  \ref{place-sample}, into the position for cobalt adsorption, with
  respect to all degrees of freedom.
\item{}The shutter at the front of the evaporator was opened.
\item{}Cobalt was allowed to be adsorbed for a time $T$ of $\sim{}1\ut{ks}$; a
  value of $T$ with a precision estimate was recorded.
\item{}The shutter at the front of the evaporator was closed.
\item{}The evaporator was switched off.
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements were conducted,
  according to the procedure in section \ref{per-1-film}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Procedure for Conducting Polarized Electron Reflection
  Measurements on One Film}
\label{per-1-film}

The purpose of this procedure is to examine the sample's magnetic
properties with each of two opposite magnetization directions, with
the order in which the magnetizations are examined varying, to protect
against drift effects.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The vacuum chamber's ion pump (figure \ref{chamber-pumps}) was
  isolated from the chamber using a gate valve, and switched off, to
  protect the polarimeter from noise from the ion pump.
\item{}The vacuum chamber's ion gauge (figure \ref{chamber-pumps}) was
  switched off, to protect the polarimeter from noise from the ion
  gauge.
\item{}The sample was magnetized, according to the procedure in
  appendix \ref{magnetize-sample}.  If the procedure being described
  here had been performed previously, then the direction chosen for
  the magnetization was opposite to that chosen, at the same stage, in
  the preceding performance of this procedure.  Otherwise, a direction
  was chosen at random.
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements, as a function of
  incident electron energy and incident beam current, were taken,
  according to the procedure in appendix \ref{per-1-direction}.
\item{}The sample was magnetized, according to the procedure in
  appendix \ref{magnetize-sample}, in the opposite direction from that
  chosen at the earlier stage in this procedure.
\item{}Polarized electron reflection measurements were taken,
  according to the procedure in appendix \ref{per-1-direction}.
\item{}The ion gauge was switched on.
\item{}The ion pump was switched on.
\item{}The valve between the ion pump and the chamber was opened.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{results}

There follow measurements, using a reflected electron beam from
several cobalt thicknesses, of the electron arrival rates at the two
detectors of the Mott polarimeter.  The measurement run for each
cobalt thickness took place over a period of approximately
$2\ut{hours}$, the total duration of the experiments being
$5\ut{days}$.  The measurements were made at room temperature.

The recorded ion fluxes and durations of the cobalt growth sessions
are presented in table \ref{recorded-growth-conditions}.

Each point in the graphs represents a rate taken as the quotient of
the number of electrons counted in the time period $256\tau$, in the
relevant conditions, and $256\tau$.  The quoted uncertainty in the
detection rate is the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution
\cite{Boas:1983:MMP}.  In addition to these points, theoretical curves
are shown.  These represent the new theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, as expanded to take account of instrumental
characteristics, by the main model of section
\ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.  For the purposes of the curves in
this chapter, the parameters are chosen, using the Marquardt-Levenberg
algorithm, for the best possible fit to the data.  The parameters
affect the goodness of fit, through three parameter combinations, each
of which includes a mixture of characteristics of the sample and of
the instrument.  The most interesting of these combinations, by virtue
of being free of un-calibrated instrumental characteristics, is the
Mott asymmetry $SP =
-\frac{4Se^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}$, which
represents the balance between the electric potential $V_1$ and the
Weiss field $B_1$, inside the sample.  The best-fit values of the Mott
asymmetry, for each film thickness, are set out in table
\ref{best-fit-asymmetries}.  From a visual inspection of published
calibration data (figure \ref{HER_Sherman},) the Sherman function is
$S \approx{} -0.23$.

The full data set consists of twenty-four graphs like the two shown,
representing three incident beam currents, at each of eight film
thicknesses.  Readers who would prefer to see the full data set,

Having presented the data in raw form, it is time to analyse and
process it in a variety of ways.  There follow comments on a visual
inspection of the data, and estimates of the Mott asymmetries (and
therefore of the reflected beam spin polarizations) obtained in the
experiments.

\section{Visual Inspection of the Data}
\label{visual}

For any given film thickness, incident beam current, and channeltron,
I find that the most salient visual feature of the data (chapter
\ref{results}) is the sign of the gradient of each electron arrival
rate against beam energy curve: the electron arrival rate decreases
with increasing energy.  The second most salient feature is the sign
of the curvature of each curve: the graph is convex $\cup$.  This
shape is as one would expect from equation \ref{reflected-intensity},
which is derived from the new theory in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}.

The third most salient visual feature of the data is the direction,
in which the electron arrival rate, for the majority of beam energies,
changes on moving from magnetization up to magnetization
down\footnote{This, of course, may be a move either forward or
  backward in time}.  My visual estimates of this direction are
presented in table \ref{movement-directions}.
\begin{table}

\caption{Visually Estimated Directions, in Which the Electron Arrival
  Rates Change on Moving from Magnetization up to Magnetization down}
\label{movement-directions}
\end{table}

This distribution of changes in electron arrival rate is interesting,
because, from the new theory in chapter \ref{theoretical-context}, and
indeed from any theory, in which the process of changing the
magnetization direction affects the arrival rates at the channeltrons
only through the reflected electron beam's spin polarization, one
would expect the changes in the two channeltrons' arrival rates, on
reversing the magnetization direction, to be opposite.  This has
(table \ref{movement-directions}) been the case in only one of the
twenty-four sets of conditions of film thickness and beam current
measured.

It is suggested that, in terms of the diagrammatic view of the
scientific method presented in ``Bayesian Interpolation''
\cite{MacKay:1992:BI}, and in ``Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models''
\cite{MacKay:1992:BMA}, this section, unlike the rest of this chapter,
belongs to the `decide whether to create new models,' stage, rather
than to the `assign preferences to the alternative models' stage
\footnote{Visual impressions have \cite{James:2003:ETD} also been used
  in this way in atmospheric science.}.  Only some qualitative
pointers to theories that \emph{might} better match the contents of
table \ref{movement-directions} will be provided; the construction of
enough quantitative detail to permit testing of new theories, in the
light of data, will be left as an exercise for any reader who wishes
to undertake it.

The author suggests three possible forms for new theories, in the
light of table \ref{movement-directions}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The precision of the positioning of the sample may be
  insufficient to prevent variation, of the kind observed in section
  \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, in the acceptance probability at the
  front of the polarimeter (the $a$ of appendix
  \ref{adaptive-models}.)  In support of this explanation, it is noted
  that, since the position of the sample is only reset on changes of
  magnetization or of film thickness, one would expect, if it were the
  correct explanation, that the direction of change of the count rate
  would be independent of channeltron number and beam current,
  depending only on film thickness, as is (table
  \ref{movement-directions}) indeed observed in almost all cases.
  However, there are two strong arguments against this explanation.
  Firstly, the precision with which the sample was positioned was
  chosen on the basis of empirical evidence (section
  \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}) about the precision needed to prevent
  this effect.  Secondly, the overall proportions of ``up'' and
  ``down'' directions of change of electron arrival rate, on
  magnetization reversal, are (table \ref{movement-directions})
  unequal, by an amount that, depending on the details of the
  explanation, may be statistically significant, and militate against
  any explanation that does not involve a true magnetic effect.
\item{}The experiment may not be performed quickly enough to prevent
  drift effects, of the kind observed in section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments} between the measurements for different
  magnetization directions on the same film thickness\footnote{Drift
  effects on the longer time-scale between measurements on different
  film thicknesses would not produce the effect that needs to be
  explained, and are modelled within appendix \ref{adaptive-models}.},
  or the drift effects may be related to switching on and off the
  channeltron, rather than to a particular time-scale.  In support of
  this explanation, it is noted that, as long as the drift effects
  relate to switching on and off the channeltrons, which occurs only
  at changes of magnetization direction or film thickness, one would
  expect, if it were the correct explanation, that the direction of
  change of the count rate would be independent of channeltron number
  and beam current, depending only on film thickness, as is (table
  \ref{movement-directions}) indeed observed in almost all cases.
  However, there are three strong arguments against this explanation.
  Firstly, the speed, with which the experiments were performed, was
  chosen on the basis of empirical evidence (section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments}) about the speed needed to prevent drift
  effects; of course, this argument does not apply, if the drift
  effects relate to switching on and off the channeltrons, rather than
  to a particular time-scale.  Secondly, the overall proportions of
  ``up'' and ``down'' directions of change of electron arrival rate,
  on magnetization reversal, are (table \ref{movement-directions})
  unequal, by an amount that, depending on the details of the
  explanation, may be statistically significant, and militate against
  any explanation that does not involve a true magnetic effect.
  Thirdly, if this explanation is correct, and the drift effects
  relate to a particular time-scale, rather than to switching on and
  off the channeltrons, then, given that the time-scale for changing
  channeltrons is only a factor of $\sim{}2$ shorter than that for
  reversing magnetization direction, one would not expect the observed
  (table \ref{movement-directions}) high degree of independence of
  channeltron number, in the direction of change of the electron
  arrival rate.
\item{}A stray magnetic field, either from the sample itself, or from
  some ferromagnetic part of the sample holder (figure \ref{holder},)
  may be deflecting the electron beam in such a way as to change the
  acceptance probability at the front of the polarimeter (the $a$ of
  appendix \ref{adaptive-models}.)  In support of this explanation, it
  is noted that one would expect, if it were the correct explanation:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}that the direction of change of the count rate would be
  independent of channeltron number and beam current, depending only
  on film thickness, as is (table \ref{movement-directions}) indeed
  observed in almost all cases, and
\item{}in contrast to any effects that are not genuinely magnetic,
  that the overall proportions of ``up'' and ``down'' directions of
  change of electron arrival rate, on magnetization reversal, would be
  unequal, as they are (table \ref{movement-directions},) by an amount
  that, depending on the details of the explanation, may be
  statistically significant.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

If more quantitative theories are constructed, based on the first two
explanations, they would be expected to have significantly more
adjustable parameters than the models in appendix
\ref{adaptive-models}, and therefore to take a prohibitive amount of
CPU time to fit to the data using a Monte Carlo method.  With
reluctance, because it would have the consequence of ignoring
evidence, which is relevant to a problem of parameter estimation and
model comparison under consideration, long-term\footnote{The author
has made some comments elsewhere \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} on how this
situation arises.}, it might, therefore, be necessary to set aside the
existing experimental results (chapter \ref{results},) and instead
assess the existing models (chapter \ref{theoretical-context},
appendix \ref{adaptive-models},) in the light of future experimental
results, with the experimental method adapted to position the sample
more precisely, to be quicker, or to avoid switching on and off the
channeltrons.

However, if more quantitative theories are constructed, based on the,
apparently more plausible, third explanation, they will provide an
exciting possibility for using electron beams to probe magnetic
surfaces, without relying on spin polarization effects.  The data in
chapter \ref{results} would be immediately suitable for use in this
process, but future experimental data could be gathered without the
practical difficulties involved in Mott polarimetry.  If, despite
this, demand for measurements of the spin polarization of reflected
beams continues to exist, it may be worthwhile to know that Lind
\cite{Lind:1987:SSG} discovered that the stray field around a sample
could be substantially reduced, by briefly applying a magnetic field,
smaller than that used to magnetize the sample and in the opposite
direction, after the sample was magnetized.

It is also, of course, possible that the future of magnetism
measurements with electron beams will take a course that the author
has not foreseen; either one for which the measurements in chapter
\ref{results} are useful, or one for which they are not useful.

In passing, it is noted that although the author is familiar with
several examples (section \ref{experimental-context})
\cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP,
  Kirschner:1985:IES, Landolt:1985:SPS, Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG,
  Lind:1987:SSA, Weber:1999:EAF} of published data, obtained using
Mott polarimeters, on the spin polarization of reflected, diffracted,
transmitted, inelastic, and secondary electron beams from magnetic and
non-magnetic materials, these all present the data in a processed
form, similar to that of section \ref{traditional-estimation-section},
rather than in the raw form of chapter \ref{results}.  This is
understandable, given the length constraints of papers in collections,
journal articles, and theses, but regrettably, renders it impossible
to apply reasoning of the kind above to these data.

Although the primary purpose of this section was to make qualitative
suggestions, it will probably be useful to make a quantitative estimate
of the deflection that a stray magnetic field produces, in a reflected
electron beam (figure \ref{circles},) as a check on the plausibility
of this suggestion.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{circles}}
\htmladdimg{./circles.png}
\caption{Deflection of an Electron Beam by a Stray Magnetic Field}
\label{circles}
\end{figure}

The classical equations of motion of an electron, in a stray magnetic flux
density, in the $z$ direction, $B$, are
\begin{equation}
\frac{\td{^2x}}{\td{t}^2} = \frac{eB}{m}\frac{\td{y}}{\td{t}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\td{^2y}}{\td{t}^2} = -\frac{eB}{m}\frac{\td{x}}{\td{t}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time, $-e$ is the charge on an electron, and $m$ is
the mass of an electron.

The general solutions of these equations of motion are
\begin{equation}
x =
-\frac{imC}{eB}\exp\left(\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+\frac{imD}{eB}\exp\left(-\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+F\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
y =
\frac{mC}{eB}\exp\left(\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+\frac{mD}{eB}\exp\left(-\frac{ieBt}{m}\right)+H\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $C$, $D$, $F$, and $H$ are arbitrary constants.  Given the
boundary conditions, for the incident beam, that, at $t = 0$, $(x,y) =
(-a,a)$ and $\left(\frac{\td{x}}{\td{t}},\frac{\td{y}}{\td{t}}\right)
= (u,-u)$, the arbitrary constants can be set, to give
\begin{equation}
x =
\frac{mu}{eB}\left(\cos\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)+\sin\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)-1\right)-a\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
y =
\frac{mu}{eB}\left(\cos\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)-\sin\left(\frac{eBt}{m}\right)-1\right)+a\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Only the electron trajectory, not the behaviour in time, is of
interest.  Therefore, it would be useful to find a time-independent
function of $x$ and $y$.  Using the advance knowledge that the
trajectory would be a circle, it was decided to seek such a function
of the form $(x-X)^2+(y-Y)^2$.  The incident electron trajectory was
thus discovered to be, where $\mu{}(B) = \frac{mu}{eB}$,
\begin{equation}
(x+\mu{}(B)+a)^2+(y+\mu{}(B)-a)^2 = 2(\mu(B))^2\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
a circle, of radius $\sqrt{2}\mu(B)$, centred on
$(-\mu{}(B)-a,-\mu{}(B)+a)$.  The $x$ co-ordinate at which the
reflection takes place, i.e.~of the intersection of this circle and
the sample surface, is
\begin{equation}
b(B) = -\mu{}(B)-a\pm\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2+2\mu{}(B)a-a^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Of the two intersections, the one of interest is that closest to the
starting point $(-a,a)$.  Therefore, where $\mu{}(B) < 0$,
\begin{equation}
b(B) = -\mu{}(B)-a-\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2+2\mu{}(B)a-a^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and where $\mu{}(B) > 0$,
\begin{equation}
b(B) = -\mu{}(B)-a+\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2+2\mu{}(B)a-a^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The reflected electron trajectory will also be a circle of radius
$\sqrt{2}\mu{}(B)$.  However, the centre will be geometrically
reflected, in the plane $x = b(B)$, to
$(\mu{}(B)+a+2b(B),-\mu{}(B)+a)$, i.e.~the trajectory is
\begin{equation}
(x-\mu{}(B)-a-2b(B))^2+(y+\mu{}(B)-a)^2 = 2(\mu{}(B))^2\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

On the assumption that $a' = a$, this trajectory strikes the
polarimeter front at an $x$ co-ordinate
\begin{equation}
c(B) = \mu{}(B)+a+b(B)\pm\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2-(b(B))^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The intersection of interest is the one closest to the starting point
$(b(B),0)$, i.e.~where $\mu{}(B) < -a$,
\begin{equation}
c(B) = \mu{}(B)+a+b(B)+\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2-(b(B))^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and where $\mu{}(B) > -a$,
\begin{equation}
c(B) = \mu{}(B)+a+b(B)-\sqrt{(\mu{}(B))^2-(b(B))^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The distance that the reflected electron beam is displaced, along the
polarimeter front, on reversing the stray field, is
\begin{equation}
d(B) = \sqrt{2}(c(B)-c(-B))\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This distance is plotted against the stray magnetic flux density in
figure \ref{plausible}, using the estimated $a = 100\ut{mm}$, and a
value of $u$ based on an estimated electron kinetic energy of
$750\ut{eV}$.

\caption{The Distance along the Polarimeter Front that the Reflected
  Electron Beam Is Displaced, on Reversing the Stray Magnetic Field,
  against Stray Magnetic Flux Density}
\label{plausible}
\end{figure}
The width of the electron beam is of the order of $1\ut{mm}$, and the
width of the polarimeter opening is of order $2\ut{mm}$.  Therefore,
any displacement of $\sim{}100\ut{\mu{}m}$ or more will have a
significant effect on the acceptance probability.  It is clear, from
the graph, that a displacement of this size can be obtained with a
realistic flux density.

\section[Traditional Estimation]{Traditional Estimation of the Mott
  Asymmetries}
\label{traditional-estimation-section}

Other workers \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP} have considered,
in a non-Bayesian framework, the possibility of the two electron
detectors in a Mott polarimeter having different detection
efficiencies $\eta_i$, either due to intrinsic properties of the
detectors, or due to a misalignment of the heavy-metal foil that
perturbed the scattering probabilities at the two detectors, and
devised the following estimator of the product $SP$ of Sherman
function and beam polarization, in the presence of such a
multiplicative systematic error:
\begin{equation}
\label{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}
SP = \frac{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}-\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}+\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This estimator relies on the electron arrival rates $f_{i,j}$, at
detectors $j = 1$ and $j = 2$, being measured for beams which, on
entering the polarimeter, are of the same intensity, and of
polarizations that have equal magnitudes, and opposite signs $i =
\pm$.  These conditions are met, in the experiments currently being
reported, as long as the only effect, on the reflected electron beam,
of reversing the sample magnetization is to reverse the beam
polarization.  In particular, this requires that the spin-orbit
interaction at the sample is negligible, as indeed it is, since the
kinetic energies of the electrons are much less than their rest mass
energy.  Note that equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator} is a
repeat, in slightly different notation, of equation \ref{rev}, and is
derived and explained in section \ref{explain}.

In this section, the results will be interpreted using equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, as an alternative to the
Bayesian inference process described in appendix
\ref{adaptive-models}.  Note that the estimator could be re-derived,
as the expectation value of $SP$ in a Bayesian model with appropriate
assumptions.  This would have the advantage of allowing these
assumptions, which would be made explicit by the Bayesian approach, to
be examined for reasonableness, and changed if necessary (see also
\emph{Some Philosophical Implications of Bayesian Statistics}
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.)  Unfortunately, the model would be a model
\emph{of} the reflected beam, not of the sample, and therefore
successful estimation of its parameters does not further the aim of
determining characteristics of the sample.

The procedure used here will be to divide the data set into subsets;
the members of any given subset will be all the measurements of
electron arrival rate taken under one particular set of conditions of
film thickness, incident beam energy, incident beam current, and data
acquisition apparatus dwell time.  By the design of the experiments,
each of these subsets will contain four measurements, of the correct
mutual relationship to be used as the $f_{i,j}$ in equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}.  This will provide three or
four asymmetry values for each combination of film thickness and beam
energy; the arithmetic mean of these is taken for presentation.  The
results of this procedure are shown in figure
\ref{grand_asyms}.

From a visual inspection of published calibration data (figure
\ref{HER_Sherman},) the Sherman function is $S \approx{} -0.23$; this
is expected to be independent of the beam energy, because the voltages
on electrodes in the polarimeter were adjusted with beam energy to
maintain a constant electron kinetic energy when the electrons arrived
at the thorium foil.  Similarly, it is expected to be independent of
film thickness, because the cobalt film whose thickness is varied is
not the thorium foil, part of the measuring apparatus, at which the
Mott scattering effect takes place; the thickness of the latter is
constant.

\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}

\caption{Traditional Estimator of Mott Asymmetry against Film

  Thickness Axis Has a Fractional Calibration Error of $\pm{}14\%$.
  The Lines Are a Guide to The Eye.  No Error Bars Are Shown; the
  Dominant Random Errors Are Those in Mott Asymmetry, Which Are of the
  Order of $0.005$.}
\label{grand_asyms}
\end{figure}

This estimator is clearly indicating non-zero asymmetries in most
cases, indicating that, despite the above-described systematic error
due to the stray field from the sample or its holder (section
\ref{visual},) the experiments have successfully detected the cobalt's
Weiss field.  This is comforting, given that a Bayesian statistical
analysis (section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff},) which the author
believes to be more rigorous than the use of the estimator in equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, will indicate (section
\ref{further-conclusions}) very decisively that the experiments have
detected the cobalt ferro-magnetism.

According to the new, classical-field theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, the reflected beam polarization is expected
to be independent of beam energy, because the theory is a zeroth order
Taylor expansion in the inverse beam energy, the films are all thick
enough that Fabry-Perot reflections from the $Co/Cu$ interface, which
would otherwise introduce an oscillatory energy dependence, are lost
to inelastic scattering, and the energies in the experiments were high
enough to be within the expected domain of validity of this Taylor
expansion.  Given the unfortunate absence of alternative theories,
directly applicable to $Co/Cu(001)$ films, hinting at the conceivable
form of a systematic energy-dependence in the polarization, it is
impossible to comment valuably on whether the data support the
hypothesis of energy-independence; it is, however, possible to comment
that the generally non-zero measured polarization values appear to
militate against versions of the theory in which the Weiss field
affecting the probing electrons, and the resulting energy-independent
polarization, are zero.

According to the new, classical-field theory of chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, the reflected beam polarization is expected
to depend on the film thickness only through the dependence of the
electrostatic potential and Weiss field in the sample on film
thickness.  The only clear pointer available to the form of this
dependence is the non-ferro-magnetic nature of bulk copper, which
would lead one to expect a zero polarization from the zero-thickness
film.  Intriguingly, the measured polarizations from the
zero-thickness film appear to depart from zero.  It is not clear
whether this is indicative of some localized magnetization at the
surface of the copper, or of a systematic error in the measured
results, such as that, discussed in a footnote above, which may be
introduced by the use of a non-linear, and therefore potentially
biased, polarization estimator, as will be discussed below (section
\ref{why-stat}.)

The size of the estimated reflected beam polarization is typically of
the order of $0.1$.  This is the same order of magnitude as most of
the published measured and theoretical reflected beam polarizations at
high beam energies, reviewed in chapter \ref{theoretical-context}.

Having used this simple estimator to analyse the data, the author will
now implement a more sophisticated, Bayesian method for parameter
estimation and model comparison.

\section[Further Discussion and Conclusions]{Further Discussion of,
and Conclusions from, the Experimental Results}
\label{relegated-bayesian-stuff}

Above, several references have been made to a Bayesian inference
process, for drawing conclusions about sample characteristics from the
experimental results.  In this section, that Bayesian inference
process is presented.  First, an explanation will be given of why the
author believes undertaking this more sophisticated inference process
to be desirable.

\subsection{Why Is This Statistical Analysis Necessary?}

The author is the first to acknowledge the benefits of having as
little complicated mathematics as possible between raw experimental
results and conclusions, in terms of the ability of complicated
calculations to conceal mistakes.  Therefore, some justification seems
to be required for the intervention of a sophisticated statistical
algorithm.  The justification will have two parts: the first will
explain why any statistical inference process is needed at all, and
the second will explain why a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
was coded, rather than using computer codes already in the public
domain.

\subsubsection{Why Use Any Statistical Inference?}
\label{why-stat}

The community of researchers using measurements of the spin
polarization of electron beams has long had available the estimator in
equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, for obtaining the spin
polarization of an electron beam, from the measured electron arrival
rates at a Mott polarimeter's two detectors; this estimator eliminates
systematic errors due to misalignment of the electron beam entering
the polarimeter, and due to unequal sensitivities of the two
detectors.  By a happy coincidence, the systematic error that may be
introduced by a stray field, which reverses with the sample
magnetization, is also multiplicative, and is, therefore, also
eliminated by this polarization estimator.

It was established, following a published derivation
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP}, in section \ref{explain} that, in the absence of
random errors, the estimator is equal to the true polarization.  Why,
therefore, cannot the estimator, along with published values of the
Sherman function $S$, be used to calculate the reflected beam
polarization, and then equations \ref{polarization} and
\ref{reflected-intensity} inverted to give the electro-magnetic
characteristics of the sample, avoiding any need for a statistical
process?

A footnote to section \ref{specific} alludes to the answer, which lies
in the seemingly innocuous phrase ``in the absence of random errors.''
Real experiments are characterized by the presence, not the absence,
of random errors, in particular, in this case, in the measured
electron arrival rates.  When there are random errors, the electron
arrival rate $f_{i,j}$, for given true values of the intensity and
polarization of the beam entering the polarimeter, $G_{\textrm{true}}$
and $P_{\textrm{true}}$, is characterized\footnote{This is not one of
the items of controversy between Bayesian and frequentist
statisticians, and is a proposition that statisticians from both camps
would accept.} by a probability density distribution
$P(f_{i,j}|G_{\textrm{true}},P_{\textrm{true}})$.  On the
four-dimensional space of the $f_{i,j}$, one can define both the joint
probability density
$\prod_{i,j}P(f_{i,j}|G_{\textrm{true}},P_{\textrm{true}})$, and the
polarization estimator $P_{\textrm{formula}}(\vc{f}) =
\frac{\sqrt{f_{1,+}f_{2,-}}-\sqrt{f_{1,-}f_{2,+}}}{\sqrt{f_{1,+}f_{2,-}}+\sqrt{f_{1,-}f_{2,+}}}$.
One can then, in principle, obtain the expectation value
$\int_{\textrm{All
space}}P_{\textrm{formula}}(\vc{f})\prod_{i,j}P(f_{i,j}|G_{\textrm{true}},P_{\textrm{true}})\td{f_{i,j}}$
of the estimator, given $G_{\textrm{true}}$ and $P_{\textrm{true}}$.
If this expectation value is equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$, the
estimator is unbiased.  If, on the other hand, the expectation value
is not equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$, it is a biased estimator; in
other words, despite its success in eliminating systematic errors due
to certain physical conditions, the estimator has created a new
systematic error of its own, out of the random errors in the electron
arrival rate measurements; this is the systematic error which, it was
suggested above, may have been responsible for the non-zero
polarization estimates obtained from bare copper.

Unfortunately, because the estimator is non-linear in the raw
measurements, it is very likely that its expectation value will not be
equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$, and that such an artificial systematic
error will arise.  Worse still, evaluating the integral, to quantify
the size of this systematic error (and possibly correct it,) is beyond
the author's analytical capabilities; it could be integrated
numerically, but this would sacrifice the advantage of mathematical
simplicity, which was the motivation for examining this estimator.
This is what justifies turning to statistical inference.

\subsubsection{Why Write New Software for the Statistical Inference?}

Having made the case for using a statistical process to obtain
information, there remains a need to explain why the results were
analysed using a new program, written by the author of this thesis,
implementing a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, rather than using
computer codes already in the public domain.  Computer codes for
statistical inference already in the public domain (or at least, those
known to the author,) such as Gnuplot \cite{Crawford:1998:G} and
Origin \cite{::GSM}, typically perform both model comparison and
parameter estimation based on the $\chi^2$ statistic for the badness
of fit of a model to the data,
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_i\left(\frac{(x_i-y_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $i$ indexes the experimental conditions where some measurements
have been made, $x_i$ is the measured value obtained in conditions
$i$, $y_i$ is the value predicted by the model in conditions $i$, and
$\sigma_i$ is the quoted random error on measurement $x_i$.  $y_i$,
and sometimes $\sigma_i$, depend on the values chosen for the model's
adjustable parameters, and on which of the distinct, discrete models
available is being considered; hence, the badness of fit $\chi^2$ also
depends on these influences.  The measure of goodness of fit used in
Bayesian statistics (and in some non-Bayesian methods) is
\cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP} the likelihood function $P(D|M,\vc{P})$, which
is the conditional probability density distribution over the space of
values of the set $D$ of measurements, given a model $M$ and a set of
model parameter values $\vc{P}$; the likelihood, like $\chi^2$,
depends on the models that are chosen.  On the common
\cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} assumption that this probability distribution,
as a function of any single measured value, is Gaussian in shape,
$\chi^2$ has a clear meaning in Bayesian statistics:
\begin{equation}
P(D|M,\vc{P}) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^N\pi^N\prod_i(\sigma_i^2)}}\exp{}\left(-\frac{\chi^2}{2}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
i.e.~$\chi^2$ is proportional to the logarithm of the likelihood.

The output given by the typical parameter estimation and model
comparison software already in the public domain consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The set $\vc{P}^*$ of values of a model's parameters that
  minimizes $\chi^2$ (equivalently, maximizes the likelihood,)
  providing an estimate of the parameter values in which it is
  reasonable to believe, given the experimental evidence; to find the
  minimum, the standard programs use the Marquadt-Levenberg algorithm,
  which is explained in \emph{Numerical Recipes}
  \cite{Press:1986:NRA},
\item{}the coefficients of a second-order Taylor expansion of the
  $\chi^2$ statistic in the parameters of a model, about $\vc{P}^*$,
  describing a parabolic approximation to $\chi^2$ (equivalently, a
  Gaussian approximation to the likelihood) in parameter space,
  providing an estimate of the uncertainty in the parameter estimates
  $\vc{P}^*$,
\item{}the maximum value $\chi^{2*}$ of the $\chi^2$ statistic, as a
  model's parameters are varied, providing an estimate of a model's
  badness of fit for model comparison purposes, and, in the case of
  Gnuplot,
\item{}a version of $\chi^{2*}$, adjusted by dividing it by the
  difference between the number of measurements and the number of
  adjustable model parameters, providing an alternative estimate of a
  model's badness of fit for model comparison purposes, which attempts
  to implement Occam's razor; the philosophical and statistical basis
  for implementing Occam's razor in this way is unclear.
\end{itemize}

The first reason for deciding against using codes of this form is that
output of a best-fit goodness of fit for model comparison leaves the
user with a problem of how to implement Occam's razor; Gnuplot's
adjusted $\chi^{2*}$ attempts to implement Occam's razor by penalizing
models for having many adjustable parameters.  However, if, like the
author, one believes that the purpose of Occam's razor is to prevent a
model from using information from experimental results to fine-tune
its parameters, then recycling the same information to act as evidence
for itself against other models, then using an Occam's razor based on
the number of adjustable parameters raises the possibility of unfairly
penalizing a model that, although it has many adjustable parameters,
does not fine-tune them very much on the basis of the experimental
data, i.e.~that is a good fit to the experimental results over a wide
range of parameter values.  As it will transpire, this is precisely
the situation encountered with the experiments and models central to
this thesis.  Bayesian methods implement \cite{MacKay:1992:BI,
MacKay:1992:BMA} Occam's razor automatically, by comparing models'
average likelihoods over all values of their parameters (known as
marginal likelihoods,) weighted according to the pre-experiment
plausibility function encoded in the prior probability distribution,
instead of comparing their maximum likelihoods; this directly
penalises \cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} models for
fine-tuning their parameters, not for merely having parameters to
fine-tune.

The author is not claiming that it would be impossible to implement a
fair Occam's razor using, for example, Gnuplot.  Indeed, since
completing the analysis of the data presented in this thesis, the
author has, in the course of a separate experimental project, devised
a formula for obtaining a marginal likelihood from the outputs of
Gnuplot.  However, some programming is required to implement this.

The second reason for deciding against using the established,
publicly available codes is that parameter estimation by a
least-squares method has a number of features, some of which tend to
render it unsuitable for use in the present project:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The assumption, needed to give $\chi^2$ a clear meaning in
  Bayesian (or any probabilistic) statistics, that the likelihood, as
  a function of the value of an individual experimental datum, for
  fixed model parameters, is a Gaussian, is reasonable, given that
  electron arrival at the detectors is expected to be a Poisson
  process, and that the numbers of electrons being counted are
  sufficiently large \cite{Boas:1983:MMP} for a Gaussian to be an
  extremely good approximation to a Poisson distribution; this
  assumption has not been challenged in the development of the
  author's Bayesian method, and will be discussed briefly below
  (section \ref{discussion-likelihood}.)
\item{}The assumption that the likelihood associated with the
  experimental data set as a whole, as a function of the adjustable
  parameters of a model, is well approximated by a Gaussian (the
  second order Taylor expansion of $\chi^2$,) cannot stand for this
  experiment and the new, classical-field model presented in chapter
  \ref{theoretical-context}.  This is because, when equation
  \ref{polarization}, which predicts the measurable reflected beam
  polarization $P$, as a function of the electrostatic potential $V$
  and Weiss field $B$ in the sample, is inverted to give the ratio
  $\frac{B}{V}$ (or $B$ or $V$ individually) as a function of $P$,
  $\frac{B}{V}$ is found not to be single-valued.  This means that the
  likelihood function has two peaks in parameter space; a Gaussian
  approximation can only hope to represent one of these peaks, and
  therefore will lose crucial information.  This difficulty is likely
  to be surmountable; one of the standard computer codes could perhaps
  be used with some function of $\frac{B}{V}$, which is a
  single-valued function of $P$, as a fitting parameter, instead of
  $B$ and $V$ separately, or $\frac{B}{V}$ itself.  Nevertheless, this
  introduces extra complication in configuring a standard fitting
  program, which slightly undermines the case in terms of simplicity
  for using a standard program.
\item{}The parabolic approximation to $\chi^2$, or Gaussian
  approximation to the likelihood, output by a least-squares
  algorithm, even, if the approximation holds, encodes only the
  goodness of fit of the model to the data as a function of the
  adjustable parameters.  In Bayesian statistics, this is only half
  the story of parameter estimation; to obtain a Bayesian ``belief
  function'' of the parameters, representing how strongly one believes
  in each conceivable set of parameter values, given the experimental
  results (this belief function is known as the posterior probability
  distribution,) the likelihood must be modulated by a plausibility
  function, or prior probability distribution, describing the level of
  credence one gives to each conceivable set of parameters before
  undertaking the experiment.  Using the output of the least-squares
  algorithm directly for parameter estimation would be equivalent to
  an implicit, fixed assumption that the prior probability
  distribution is uniform over parameter space.  Elsewhere
  \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, the author has expressed concern over the
  philosophical consequences of prior probability distributions being
  implicit and fixed.  Here, it is possible to be more pragmatic,
  simply noting that for many parameters, a uniform prior probability
  distribution is inappropriate: for example, the parameter might be a
  quantum efficiency, in which case it makes sense to give it a
  non-zero prior probability density for parameter values between zero
  and one, and a zero prior probability density outside this domain;
  alternatively, standard data tables might give an estimate and
  uncertainty for the parameter, based on previous experimental
  evidence, which could be well represented by a Gaussian prior
  probability distribution.  This problem is also likely to be
  surmountable: since completing the analysis of the data presented in
  this thesis, the author has, in the course of a separate
  experimental project, examined the possibility of transforming a
  parameter $a$, over which a prior probability distribution $P(a)$ is
  required, to a parameter $b$, which is a function of $a$, such that
  $P(a)\td{a} = \td{b}$, i.e.~the prior probability distribution over
  $b$ is uniform, and $b$ can be used as a fitting parameter in a
  least-squares algorithm; it transpires that, for the common forms of
  $P(a)$ that the author has examined to date, the differential
  equation has a ready analytical solution, providing a simple formula
  to transform between $a$ and $b$.  Nevertheless, this introduces
  extra complication in configuring a standard fitting program, which
  slightly undermines the case in terms of simplicity for using a
  standard program.
\end{itemize}

To summarize, there are certain obstacles to the use of computer codes
already in the public domain to undertake a valid analysis of the
experimental data presented in this project.  Although methods of
working around these obstacles could be devised, these methods entail
some mathematical and computational complication, and therefore
compromise the advantage of simplicity that would be the motivation
for choosing existing computer codes.  Therefore, the author has, for
the purposes of this project, chosen instead to use a fundamentally
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for parameter estimation and
model comparison, and to code this method anew, in the high-level
programming language Perl; the choice of such a high-level language
may recover some of the simplicity lost by choosing to write new code.

Having explained why the inference method has been chosen, it is time
to undertake parameter estimation and model comparison according to
that method.

\subsection{Statistical Inference Process}
\label{adaptive-models}

In this section, the data presented in chapter \ref{results} will be
used to estimate the values of the adjustable parameters in two models
of the system of samples and measuring apparatus, and to compare the
two models.  The framework used for this data interpretation will be
Bayesian inference \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP, Howson:1989:SRB,
MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA, MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI}.
The finer mathematical details of the inference method, including the
prior probability distributions and likelihood functions, and a
description of the numerical method used for the calculations, will be
presented in section \ref{inference-method-details}.

\subsubsection{Framework of the Models}
\label{framework}

Both models are based on the new theory of polarized electron
reflection from a bulk sample presented in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}.  The use of a model intended for a bulk
sample is justified on the basis that the inelastic mean free path of
electrons, of the energies used in this experiment, is
\cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF} no more than $\sim{}1\ut{nm}$,
with the result that even rather thin films will appear, when examined
with an electron beam, to be bulk materials.

Therefore, when the beam current into the electron gun is $F$, the
rate of electron incidence on the sample is $F/e$, and the rate of
electrons leaving the sample, in the reflected beam (figure \ref{sd},)
is, from integration of equation \ref{reflected-amplitude},
\begin{equation}
G = \left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The polarization of the reflected beam is, from equation
\ref{polarization},
\begin{equation}
P = -\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The electrostatic potential, $V$, and the magnetic flux density, $B$,
in the sample, are adjustable parameters of the ``main'' model, while
in the ``null'' model, only $V$ is adjustable, $B$ being fixed at
zero.  In fact, since there are eight cobalt film thicknesses,
including zero thickness (table \ref{recorded-growth-conditions},)
there are multiple parameters of this type, $V_j$ and $B_j$, with the
film thicknesses indexed by integers $j$, from $0$ to $7$ inclusive;
for thickness $0$, $B_0$ is fixed at zero even for the ``main'' model.
These then lead to electron leaving rates $G_j$ and reflected
polarizations $P_j$.

Since the entrance hole of the polarimeter (figure \ref{sd}) is of
finite width, it is possible that not all of the electrons in the
reflected beam will enter the polarimeter.  Therefore, an acceptance
probability $a$ is defined, so that the rate of electrons entering the
polarimeter is $aG_j$.  The entrance hole and grids are assumed to be
non-polarizing, with the result that the polarization of the beam
entering the polarimeter is $P_j$.

The thorium foil then scatters electrons towards the two channeltrons.
The rate of electron arrival at channeltron $1$ will be, by equation
\ref{r1},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(1, j)} = \Gamma{}(1+SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and that at channeltron $2$ will be, by equation \ref{r2},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(2, j)} = \Gamma{}(1-SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where the spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma$ and the
Sherman function $S$ are characteristics of the thorium foil.
Calibration values of $\Gamma$ and $S$ for a Mott polarimeter, of
identical design to that used for these experiments, have been
provided by other workers \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}, and those for
electrons with energy $20\ut{keV}$ are reproduced in figures
\ref{HER_Average} and \ref{HER_Sherman}.  Although the energy of the
electrons on striking the thorium foil, in the experiments presented
in this thesis, is $(20.5\pm{}0.00725)\ut{keV}$, not $20\ut{keV}$, the
systematic error introduced by this energy difference
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} is negligible, compared with the quantization
error of the author's readings from the published graphs (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood}.)

  quadrature of the standard deviation associated with the
  quantization of the author's readings from the published graph, and
  the error quoted on the published graph.}
\label{HER_Sherman}
\end{figure}

The published calibration data are for electron energies, on striking
the thorium foil, of $20\ut{keV}$ and $25\ut{keV}$, and are presented
as a function of the energy loss window $W$, defined by the potential
at the retarding grids (chapter \ref{compact}.)  The author has chosen
to include the published data for a $20\ut{keV}$ energy, on striking
the thorium foil, in the data set (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood},) from which inference is to proceed, and
to characterize the thorium foil by by twelve adjustable parameters,
$\Gamma_k$ and $S_k$, where $k$ runs through integers from $0$ to $5$
inclusive,
\begin{equation}
\label{Gammamodel}
\Gamma = \sum_{k=0}^5\Gamma_kW^k\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{Smodel}
S = \sum_{k=0}^5S_kW^k\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

These fifth order Taylor expansions are an extension, to calibration
data that include relatively large energy loss windows, of the spirit
of the first and second order Taylor expansions in ``Use of thorium as
a target in electron-spin analyzers'' \cite{McClelland:1989:UTT}.  The
fifth order has been chosen to provide a number of adjustable
parameters, in each Taylor expansion, that is the largest integer less
than or equal to half the number of calibration data points, in line
with MacKay's \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} recommendation
for the number of parameters in neural network models.

Channeltron $i$ (figure \ref{channeltron},) used in single-electron
counting mode in these experiments, has a detection efficiency
$\eta_i$, adjusted by a time-dependent perturbation $p_{ij}$ to allow
for drift (section \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)  Since the speed of
the present experiments has been chosen so that the drift should not
be significant within the time-scale of measurements on a single film
thickness, each channeltron has just one $p_{ij}$ value for each film
thickness; the subscript $j$, as before, indexes the film thickness.
Therefore, the electron detection rate at the channeltron $i$, from
film thickness $j$, is predicted to be
\begin{equation}
\label{predicted-detection-rate}
f_p^{(i, j)} = p_{ij}\eta_if_a^{(i, j)}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The $p_{ij}$ and $\eta_i$ values are further adjustable parameters of
the model.

\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{further-conclusions}

This section describes the conclusions, obtained from the Bayesian
inference process, about the parameters in the two models, and about
which model is correct.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The electrostatic potential in the sample, as a function of
  cobalt thickness, in the null model, is as shown in figure
  \ref{estatpotnull}.

  $(78\pm{}11)\ut{\mu{}m}\ut{A}^{-1}\ut{s}^{-1}$.}

\item{}The electrostatic potential in the sample, as a function of
  cobalt thickness, in the main model, is as shown in figure

  $(78\pm{}11)\ut{\mu{}m}\ut{A}^{-1}\ut{s}^{-1}$.}
\label{estatpotmain}

\label{magfluxmain}
\end{figure}
\item{}The posterior probability of the null model, in which cobalt
  ferro-magnetism is not detected, is estimated at
  \input{null-posterior}, and that of the main model, in which cobalt
  ferro-magnetism is detected, at \input{main-posterior}.
\end{enumerate}

At first glance, the precision of the inferred electrostatic
potentials and magnetic flux densities appears a rather unimpressive
return on the experimental effort involved in obtaining the
measurements.  In addition, a comparison (tables \ref{null-compare},
\ref{main-compare}) of the beliefs held about all of the parameters,
including those concerned with instrumental calibration and with
transient instrumental characteristics, before and after the data in
chapter \ref{results}, along with the published calibration data
(figures \ref{HER_Average}, \ref{HER_Sherman},) have been taken into
account, shows a broadening, rather than the narrowing that one might
expect, of the probability distribution over the parameter set, due to
the data.

However, the very decisive choice of model with successful detection
of the Weiss field as the better model supplies a greater reward.

\subsection{The Details of the Inference Method}
\label{inference-method-details}
\subsubsection{Standard Probability Distributions}

In this process, definitions of some standard probability density
distributions will be useful.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The Dirac delta function is such that
\begin{equation}
\delta{}(x) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for $x \neq{} 0$, and
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}\delta{}(x)\td{x} = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for any $\epsilon > 0$.  This probability distribution expresses the
certainty that $x = 0$.
\item{}The Gaussian probability distribution is
\begin{equation}
G(x; \mu{}, \sigma{}) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{}\left(-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This probability distribution is a standard default, much beloved
\cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} of the physics community, for
the distribution over a parameter $x$, knowledge of which can be
summarized by an expected value $\mu$ and a degree of variation
$\sigma$ about the expected value.
\item{}A perfect top-hat function is
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = \frac{1}{h-l}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
otherwise.  This probability distribution expresses the certainty that
a parameter $x$ lies between $l$ and $h$, and has equal probability of
lying in any fixed-width subset of that domain.  It is useful, for
example, where $x$ is a probability, and therefore must lie between
$0$ and $1$, or where $x$ is a measurement, quantized in units $h-l$
with an unknown origin by a digital meter, of a parameter
$\frac{h+l}{2}$.  In the rest of this section, an adapted version of
the perfect top-hat
\begin{equation}
T(x; l, h)\frac{127}{128(h-l)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
\begin{equation}
T(x; l, h) = G\left(x; \frac{h+l}{2}, \frac{h-l}{5.32}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
otherwise, is used.  This distribution has a probability
$\frac{127}{128}$ of being in the top-hat region, and a probability
density outside this region equal to a Gaussian of appropriate width
\cite{Manura:2002:M, ::ESH} for the probability integrated over this
region to be $\frac{1}{128}$.  Not only is this a more realistic
belief density than a perfect top-hat, it provides a probability
density gradient outside the top-hat region, which will help the
leapfrog proposal density (section \ref{monte-carlo}) to reduce the
random walk behaviour of the metropolis method.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Prior Probability Distributions}
\label{discussion-prior}

Bayesian estimation of the parameters in a model, on the basis of
experimental data, requires \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP, MacKay:1992:BI,
MacKay:1992:BMA} the explicit statement of prior probability
distributions, representing the beliefs that are held about the
parameters, before the experimental data are examined.  The author has
made some remarks about the importance of this requirement elsewhere
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.  The prior probability distributions for this
problem are presented in tables \ref{priortable} and
\ref{priortable2}.

Justifications for these prior probability distributions follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}For the acceptance probability $a$, a uniform distribution over
  the range from $0$ to $1$ seems sensible, given that we know very
  little about the properties of this system, other than that the
  energy loss window at the front of the polarimeter is (table
  \ref{polarimeter-voltages}) held constant throughout the
  experiments.
\item{}The author and collaborators performed (section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments}) experiments, before those described
  here, which provided a rough estimate of the extent of the drift in
  the channeltron detection efficiencies.  The magnitude of the drift
  was found to be $\sim{}10\%$ peak-to-peak, on a typical time-scale
  of the order of a few hours.  The time-scale is represented in the
  division of the data set into chronologically contiguous subsets,
  which, by the design of the present experiment, coincide with single
  film thicknesses, and the magnitude in the standard deviation of the
  prior probability distributions over the time-dependent
  perturbations $p_{ij}$.
\item{}The scattering probability $\Gamma$ at the thorium foil must be
  in the range between zero and one, leading to the top-hat form for
  the distribution over $\Gamma_0$.
\item{} In the distributions over $\Gamma_k$, $k > 0$, the typical
  range of variation of the scattering probability over the energy
  scale of the experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor
  expansion, is asserted to be one.
\item{}The Sherman function $S$ at the thorium foil must be in the
  range between $-1$ and one, leading to the top-hat form for the
  distribution over $S_0$.
\item{}In the distributions over $S_k$, $k > 0$, the typical range of
  variation of the Sherman function over the energy scale of the
  experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor expansion, is
  asserted to be two.
\item{}Because the front ends of the channeltrons are earthed, the
  electrons reach them with the same kinetic energy that they have at
  the sample.  This means that the energies of the electrons, on
  arrival at the channeltrons, will range from $250\ut{eV}$ to
  $1500\ut{eV}$.  The detection efficiencies of channeltrons of the
  type used, in this energy range, are \cite{::CEM} between $0.78$ and
  $0.89$.  Therefore, a top-hat probability distribution, with these
  as its limits, is used for $\eta_i$.  The author does not believe
  that it is worthwhile to create an energy-dependent model, since the
  uncertainty in the efficiency, at a particular energy, is
  \cite{Bordoni:1971:CEM, ::CEM} comparable with its variation with
  energy, over this range.
\item{}It can be assumed that, in as much as the sample is believed to
  be bulk, the bulk material in question is, for $j > 0$, cobalt, or,
  for the clean sample $j = 0$, copper, because the meaning of
  ``bulk'' is ``topmost layer too thick for the electron beam to
  penetrate,'' i.e.  of a thickness that is large compared with
  $1\ut{nm}$ \cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF}.  Therefore, the
  electrostatic potential $V_j$ is expected to be the difference in
  expected work function between stainless steel, which is the
  material from which the front end of the electron gun, which sets
  the zero of potential for the electrons, is constructed, and copper
  for $j = 0$, or cobalt for other film thickness indices $j$.  The
  width of the distribution of $V_j$ can be estimated by combining in
  quadrature the random errors $\Delta\Phi_l = 0.05\Phi_l$
  \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} in measured work functions for the
  materials.  The work functions are $\Phi_{SS} = 4.1\ut{V}$ for
  stainless steel \cite{:2001:KPF}, $\Phi_{Cu} = 4.65\ut{V}$ for
  copper \cite{:2001:PTE}, and $\Phi_{Co} = 5\ut{V}$ for cobalt
  \cite{:2001:PTE}.
\item{}For the copper surface $j = 0$ in the main model, and for all
  film thickness indices $j$ in the null model, there are assumed to
  be no magnetic effects; the magnetic flux densities $B_j$ acting on
  the electrons, in these cases, are certainly zero.
\item{}The magnetic flux density $B_j$ that affects the electrons is
  expected to be the same effective field, originating in the exchange
  interaction \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE}, which creates
  ferro-magnetism.  For the samples with a cobalt surface, $j > 0$, in
  the main model, a prior expectation of zero will be used, with the
  width of the prior probability distribution, i.e. the typical size
  of the flux density, being given by the order-of-magnitude estimate
  $\frac{k_Bm_eT_c}{e\hbar}$ of the strength of this Weiss field that
  can \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} be obtained from the Curie temperature
  $T_C$.  This is the only difference between the null and main
  models.
\end{itemize}

The parameters are taken, a priori, to be independent.  Therefore, the
prior probability density of the parameter vector
\begin{eqnarray}
\vc{Q} & = & (Q_1,Q_2,\ldots{},Q_{47})\br
& = &
(a,p_{10},\ldots{},p_{17},p_{20},\ldots{},p_{27},\Gamma_0,\ldots{},\Gamma_5,S_0,\ldots{},S_5,\eta_1,\eta_2,\br
& & V_0,\ldots{},V_7,B_0,\ldots{},B_7)
\end{eqnarray}
is
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\vc{Q}|M_n) & = & \prod_{m=1}^{47}P(Q_m|M_n)\br
& = &
P(a|M_n)\left(\prod_{i=1}^2\prod_{j=0}^7P(p_{ij}|M_n)P(\eta_i|M_n)P(V_j|M_n)P(B_j|M_n)\right)\br
& & \times\left(\prod_{k=0}^5P(\Gamma_k|M_n)P(S_k|M_n)\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

There are also prior probabilities of each model, with any set of
parameter values.  These are taken to be
\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_N) & = & P(M_M)\br
& = & \frac{1}{2}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{The Likelihood}
\label{discussion-likelihood}

The data set $D$ is the disjunction of the set $D_0$ of results of the
present experiments (chapter \ref{results},) the set $D_{\Gamma}$ of
published $\Gamma$ calibration data (figure \ref{HER_Average},) and
the set $D_S$ of published $S$ calibration data (figure
\ref{HER_Sherman}.)

For each measured electron arrival rate $f_m^{(i, j)} \in{} D_0$, the
expectation of $f_m^{(i, j)}$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$,
is $f_p^{(i, j)}$ (equation \ref{predicted-detection-rate},)
calculated using parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, and the values of $E_b$
and $F$ pertaining to the data point in question.  There are two
known, significant sources of uncertainty in this prediction.  The
first results from the Poisson process \cite{Boas:1983:MMP} of
discrete electron arrivals at the channeltron, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}}$, where $256\tau$ is the time interval, over
which electrons are counted to obtain the arrival rate $f_m^{i, j}$.
The second results from the standard deviation uncertainty
$\Delta{}F$, in the incident beam current $F$, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\frac{f_p^{(i,
    j)}\Delta{}F}{F}$.  These are combined in quadrature to give an
overall standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i, j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}$.  The
likelihood function is then taken to be
\begin{equation}
P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q}) = G\left(f_m^{(i, j)}; f_p^{(i, j)},
  \sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i,
        j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_0|\vc{Q}) = \prod_{f_m^{(i, j)}\in{}D_0}P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma_E \in{}
D_{\Gamma}$, the expectation of $\Gamma_E$, with a given parameter
vector $\vc{Q}$, is $\Gamma$ (equation \ref{Gammamodel},) calculated
using the $\Gamma_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value of $W$ relevant to
$\Gamma_E$.  The uncertainty is introduced by the quantization, in
units of $q_{\Gamma} = 0.001$, of the author's readings from the
published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs.  This gives
\begin{equation}
P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q}) = T\left(\Gamma_E; \Gamma{}-\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2},
  \Gamma{}+\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_{\Gamma}|\vc{Q}) =
\prod_{\Gamma_E\in{}D_{\Gamma}}P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured Sherman function $S_E \in{} D_S$, the expectation of
$S_E$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, is $S$ (equation
\ref{Smodel},) calculated using the $S_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value
of $W$ relevant to $S_E$.  As well as the published
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} uncertainty $\Delta{}S_E$, uncertainty is
introduced by the quantization, in units of $q_S = 0.025$, of the
author's readings from the published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs:
the standard deviation associated with this is
$\frac{q_S}{\sqrt{12}}$.  These are combined in quadrature, to give a
standard deviation $\sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}$.  The
likelihood is then taken to be
\begin{equation}
P(S_E|\vc{Q}) = G\left(S_E; S,
  \sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_S|\vc{Q}) =
\prod_{S_E\in{}D_S}P(S_E|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For a given parameter vector, the three data sets are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D|\vc{Q}) = P(D_0|\vc{Q})P(D_{\Gamma}|\vc{Q})P(D_S|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Posterior Probability Distribution}
\label{discussion-posterior}

The posterior probability distribution over the parameters in the null
model (tables \ref{priortable}, \ref{priortable2}) $M_N$ is given by
Bayes' theorem \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP}:
\begin{equation}
P(\vc{Q}|D, M_N) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_N)}{P(D|M_N)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D|M_N) = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}P(\vc{Q}|M_N)P(D|\vc{Q})\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for the main model,
\begin{equation}
P(\vc{Q}|D, M_M) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_M)}{P(D|M_M)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D|M_M) = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}P(\vc{Q}|M_M)P(D|\vc{Q})\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The posterior probabilities of the models are
\begin{equation}
\label{null-posterior}
P(M_N|D) = \frac{P(D|M_N)P(M_N)}{P(D)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{main-posterior}
P(M_M|D) = \frac{P(D|M_M)P(M_M)}{P(D)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D) = P(M_N)P(D|M_N)+P(M_M)P(D|M_M)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Parameter Estimation and Model Comparison}
\label{monte-carlo}

The posterior probability distributions of section
\ref{discussion-posterior} constitute a complete description of the
author's beliefs about the models and their parameters, once the data
(chapter \ref{results}) are taken into account.  However, it is a very
unwieldy description, consisting as it does of two scalar fields
defined on a $47$-dimensional space.  A summary is required for
presentation.  The author believes that the most useful summary will
be to give, for each parameter $Q_m$, estimates of its posterior
marginal expectations
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_N> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_N)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_M> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_M)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and of its posterior marginal standard deviations,
\begin{equation}
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_N) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_N>-<Q_m|D, M_N>^2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_M) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_M>-<Q_m|D, M_M>^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
<Q_m^2|D, M_n> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_m^2P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The summary should also include the estimates of the model posterior
probabilities $P(M_n|D)$ (equations \ref{null-posterior},
\ref{main-posterior}.)

If a means can be found of drawing samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}$ from the distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$, where $i$ runs
from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to $J$, and the total number of
samples is, therefore, $IJ$, $<Q_m|D, M_n>$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH}
be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^JQ_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Similarly, $\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_n)$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH} be
estimated by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n)}
=\sqrt{\frac{IJ(\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
      i)}-(\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)})^2)}{IJ-1}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J((Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)})^2)}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Similarly, if a means can be found of drawing samples
$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i, j)}$ from the distribution
$P(\vc{Q}|M_n)$, where $i$ runs from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to
$J$, and the total number of samples is, therefore, $IJ$, $P(D|M_n)$
can \cite{Gallagher::MFH} be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n)} =
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^jP(D|\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i, j)})}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

All of these estimators are \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} non-Bayesian,
i.e.~they coincide exactly with Bayesian posterior expectations of the
quantities being estimated, given the samples, only for specific, but
not specified, prior probability distributions over moments of the
distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$.  The estimators will, therefore,
differ by an amount $\delta$ from the posterior expectations that
would be obtained with explicit statements of plausible prior
probability distributions over these moments, if this were technically
feasible.  Fortunately, however, the size of $\delta$ tends
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} to decrease with decreasing marginal
likelihood, i.e.~with increasing number of samples.  Equally
fortunately, when the inference process aims to estimate moments of a
probability distribution, from samples from that distribution, a
critical $\delta$ for each moment is made available, by the degree of
variation implied by the higher moments, such that significantly
smaller values of $\delta$ can be safely ignored.  All this means
that, for large numbers of samples, the non-Bayesian estimators are
acceptable.

The means of obtaining samples is the leapfrog method.  This is
explained in detail in \emph{Information Theory, Inference and
  Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, where it is attributed
to Skilling.  Each iteration of the method consists of the application
of a leapfrog proposal density, followed by the application of a
Metropolis decision algorithm.  For sampling from the posterior
probability distribution, after the $i$th iteration, the method's
state is a set of $J$ parameter vectors $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  j)}$, which are the samples to be used in the estimators.  The
leapfrog proposal density sets
\begin{equation}
\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)} = 2\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  k)}-\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where, for each $j$, a $k$ is chosen at random from the other $J-1$
integers from $1$ to $J$, with each of these being equi-probable.  The
Metropolis decision algorithm then works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}if $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
    M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)} \geq{} 1$, then
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set to
    $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$.  Otherwise,
  \item{}$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set at random, either
    to $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$, or to
    $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $1-\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$.
\end{itemize}
An analogous process is used to draw samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri},
  n, i, j)}$ from the prior probability distribution.

As part of the preparation of the present thesis, the author has
written Perl code that implements the leapfrog method; in the
transparent copy of this thesis, the code for the null model $M_N$ is
in the file \patio{null}, and the code for the main model $M_M$ is in
the file \patio{main}.  As far as the author has been able to
discover, the present thesis is the first use of the leapfrog method
to infer parameters and model likelihoods from real experimental data.
Some further details are needed to define the particular version of
the leapfrog method used in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Initial vector sets $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)}$ and
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ are chosen, centred around the
  analytically-derived prior expectation values $<Q_m|M_n>$ of the
  parameters.  The displacements of the $J$ initial vectors from the
  prior expectation are picked randomly from a perfect top-hat
  distribution out to a maximum size of each displacement component,
  which is the product of a constant factor $\alpha_{pri}$ or
  $\alpha_{pos}$, and the prior standard deviation $\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n)$
  of the relevant parameter.  That is to say, $Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n,
    0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{,}
\]
and $Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{.}
\]
It has \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} been shown that the leapfrog method
rapidly grows an initial vector set that is narrower than the
distribution, from which one wishes to sample.  However, the author
does not know of any analogous proof that the algorithm can shrink an
initial vector set that is broader than the distribution, from which
one wishes to sample.  Therefore, the initial vector set, for sampling
from the prior probability distribution is made a factor of
$\exp{}(1)$, in each dimension, narrower than the prior probability
distribution.  An attempt is made to achieve the same for the
posterior probability distribution, using a guess at the width of the
posterior probability distribution.  This gives $\alpha_{pri} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\exp{}(1)}$, and $\alpha_{pos} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{(|D|-A)\exp{}(1)}$, where $|D| = 1018$ is the number
of data points, and the number of adjustable parameters is $A = 39$
for the null model $M_N$, and $A = 46$ for the main model $M_M$,
because a parameter whose prior probability distribution is a Dirac
delta function is not truly adjustable.  One further complication is
that it is necessary to ensure that, in each dimension, the width of
the initial vector set is comfortably greater than the quantum of
floating point numbers of the order of magnitude of $<Q_m|M_n>$.
Mantissae have 53 bits `on typical hardware' \cite{Ramirez:2002:PD}.
One bit is assumed to be taken up by the sign, and four bits are left,
to provide 16 possible starting ordinates, i.e.~if the half-width of
the top-hat distribution is less than $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$, it is
adjusted to $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$.
\item{}The author believes that the number $J$ of state vectors
  maintained simultaneously, in the Monte Carlo algorithm, must be at
  least the number $A$ of adjustable parameters.  This is because
  every state vector ever obtained will be some linear combination of
  the $J$ initial state vectors, and to obtain a representative
  sample, the $J$ initial state vectors must, therefore, span the
  parameter space.  In this thesis, therefore, $J = 2A$ is chosen,
  rather than the $J = 6$ or $J = 12$ suggested in \emph{Information
    Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}.
\item{}The author also believes that having a large value of $J$ will
  ameliorate the problem, noted by MacKay \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, of
  the state vectors in the leapfrog algorithm becoming stuck
  permanently at one vector set, after it has converged, because, as
  long as the parameter of interest varies smoothly in $\vc{Q}$ space,
  as the $Q_m$ must, if $J \gg{} 1$, there will be a reasonable
  sampling of the distribution even if all the individual state
  vectors are stationary.  $P(D|\vc{Q}, M_n)$, however, might not vary
  smoothly is $\vc{Q}$ space.  Therefore, the quantitative estimates
  of $P(D|M_n)$ obtained herein should be treated with some
  scepticism.

Having presented and discussed the results of the main experiments, it
is now time to present results of some similar, earlier experiments;
the primary use of these experiments will not be in inferring physical
properties of samples, but in identifying imperfections in the
experimental methods, the solutions to which motivate, and are built
into, the experimental methods above.

\section{Intermediate Experiment 1}
\label{autumn-2001-experiments}

A preliminary experiment, related to this thesis, was described in
\emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
\cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  That report presents Mott asymmetries of
reflected electron beams from a $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ structure, using
the estimator of equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}.
Those measurements are of much lower precision than the measurements
presented in this thesis (chapter \ref{results}, section
\ref{traditional-estimation-section},) and the report remains of
interest primarily for its list of the adaptations that were made to
the polarimeter, and to the measurement technique, in order to bring
it into a sufficiently functional condition to undertake the
preliminary experiment.  That list is repeated in section
\ref{repeated-adaptation-list} of this thesis.  Similarly, this
section, and section \ref{july-2002-experiments}, are concerned with
the polarimetry measurements that were performed after the preliminary
experiment, and before the main experiment of part
\ref{main-experiment}, the technical adaptations that were discovered
to be necessary, as a result of those intermediate measurements, and
the implementation of those adaptations.

After the preliminary experiment, considerable resources were devoted
to equipment repairs, and to safety-related upgrades, which did not
constitute adaptations of the polarimeter, or of the measurement
technique.  Once this was done, concerted efforts began to produce
more decisive polarized electron reflection measurements than those in
that report, starting with pilot experiments on $Co/Cu(001)$
structures, without the added manganese; compared with most of the
preliminary measurements, lower beam energies were used in the
intermediate experiments, leading to more intense reflected beams, and
greater precision in the current (or electron arrival rate)
measurements at the channeltrons.

In the first such intermediate experiment, the method was very similar
to that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences
being that the channeltrons were used as Faraday cups, measuring
continuous currents, instead of counting individual electrons, and
that the position of the sample was only set to a precision of
$1\ut{mm}$ in translational degrees of freedom, and $1^{\circ}$ in the
rotational degree of freedom with the vertical rotation axis.  Some of
the results are displayed in table \ref{intthick1} and figures
% \ref{20011205_Polarimetry}, \ref{20011205_Polarimetry_2},
% \ref{20011206_Polarimetry}, \ref{20011121_Polarimetry},
\ref{20011207_Polarimetry}, \ref{20011211_Polarimetry}, and

In addition to the polarized electron reflection measurements, Auger
electron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction were used
for structural characterization of some of these samples.  They
revealed that the copper surfaces produced by a sputtering and
annealing process of similar extent to that in chapter \ref{results}
were clean and well ordered, and that a significant amount of cobalt
was being deposited.

A number of features of the data stand out.  Firstly, instead of being
downward sloping and convex $\cup$, the electron arrival rate as a
function of beam energy is upward sloping and concave $\cap$.  After
independent tests of the voltage arriving at the retarding grids
(figure \ref{sd},) this was attributed to the power supply in use for
the retarding grids having the wrong polarity to maintain a constant
energy loss window, resulting in an energy loss window that increased
at twice the rate of increase of the incident beam energy, and a
$\Gamma$ (figure \ref{HER_Average}) that increased with increasing
incident beam energy.  A new power supply, with the correct polarity,
was procured for the experiments described in section
\ref{july-2002-experiments} and section \ref{method}.  Secondly,
the electron arrival rate for a given set of conditions was not
reproduce-able, as is vividly displayed in the histograms of the
detector current, which are clearly multi-modal.  After independent
tests of the current arriving at a given detector, as the sample
position was varied, this was attributed to the variation in position
of the sample between different measurements, and a corresponding
variation in the fraction of the specularly reflected beam that was
accepted at the front of the polarimeter.  Fortunately, the same tests
indicated that a precision of $0.1\ut{mm}$ in the translational
degrees of freedom, and $0.1^{\circ}$ in the rotation about the
vertical axis, which was feasible with the available equipment (figure
\ref{holder},) would be adequate to render this effect negligible.
Thirdly, at the low incident beam energies, where the energy loss
window was in the region where $S$ is large enough to provide spin
sensitivity (figure \ref{HER_Sherman},) $\Gamma$ was so small as to
stretch the limits of the sensitivity of continuous current
measurements.  For subsequent experiments (section
\ref{july-2002-experiments}, section \ref{method},) therefore, a move
was made to single electron counting.  To succeed in this move
required the procurement and installation of new channeltrons.

\section{Intermediate Experiment 2}
\label{july-2002-experiments}

In the second intermediate experiment, the method was very similar to
that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences being
that longer dwell times were used, and more electron counts were
recorded, resulting in an experiment that lasted around $17\ut{hours}$
for each film thickness, rather than the $2\ut{hours}$ or so of the
experiment in part \ref{main-experiment}.  Some of the results are

In addition to the polarized electron reflection experiments, one of
the author's colleagues confirmed using MOKE measurements that the
films on substrates 5 and 7 were ferromagnetic \cite{Kopper:2002:ESP}.

In many cases, the electron arrival rate appears not to be a smooth
function of the incident beam energy.  Inspection of the detailed data
sets, based on the counts in single periods of $\tau$, rather than of
$256\tau$, reveals that this is associated with a gradual variation in
time of the count rate, for fixed conditions\footnote{These detailed
data sets are available in the transparent copy of this thesis, in the
files whose names contain the word ``detailed.''}.  The variations are
tentatively attributed to drift in the detection efficiencies of the
channeltrons, and have an amplitude of approximately $10\%$ of the
average sensitivity peak-to-peak, on a time-scale of the order of a
few hours.  This is the reason for much faster experiments being used
in the main experiment of this chapter.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{experiment-conclusions}

Having presented and analysed the experimental results, it is time to
summarize the conclusions that can be drawn from these results.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}A non-zero Weiss field in the cobalt films has been detected;
  according to the Bayesian model comparison method, the experimental
  data rule out the null hypothesis, in which no such field has been
  detected, very strongly indeed, leaving it with a posterior
  probability of \input{null-posterior}; this is about as firm a
  conclusion as it is conceivable to obtain, although properties of
  the Monte Carlo method used to estimate this probability suggest
  that some caution should be applied to the sheer size of the number.
\item{}The traditional estimator of the Mott asymmetry, and therefore
  of the reflected electron beam's spin polarization, provides
  well-defined, mostly non-zero values, indicating, in support of the
  last aforesaid Bayesian conclusion, that, despite the systematic
  error in the electron arrival rates, described below, the
  experiments have successfully detected the cobalt's Weiss field.
\item{}The experimental results can be used to estimate quantitatively
  the electrostatic potential $V$ and Weiss field $B$ in the samples;
  the estimates obtained, using the Bayesian parameter estimation
  method, are shown in figures \ref{estatpotmain} and
  \ref{magfluxmain}.  As can be seen from the figures, the estimates
  produced are extremely imprecise, i.e.~the quoted standard deviation
  random errors in them are very large.  The bulk of the large random
  error does not result from the posterior probability distribution,
  over the electrostatic potential or Weiss field, having a wide peak,
  but rather from this probability distribution having two
  widely-separated peaks, associated with the fact that the
  theoretical equation \ref{polarization}, when inverted to give the
  ratio $\frac{B}{V}$, as a function of the measurable reflected beam
  polarization, gives two solutions for $\frac{B}{V}$, for any given
  polarization; however, the moderately large random errors found in
  the traditional estimators of Mott asymmetry, related to the fact
  that the measured beam polarization is, in some sense, a small
  difference between two large numbers (the spin-up and spin-down
  currents,) suggest that each of the two peaks will itself be quite
  broad.  Ironically, this lack of precision contributes positively to
  the ability to draw such an immensely firm conclusion that a
  non-zero Weiss field has been detected; underlying the Occam's razor
  that implements \cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} itself
  automatically in Bayesian statistics is the idea that a model should
  not be allowed to use information from experimental data to
  fine-tune its adjustable parameters, then recycle the same
  information to support it against other models.  In the problem at
  hand, the model with extra adjustable parameters (non-zero Weiss
  fields in the cobalt films) does not significantly fine-tune those
  parameters using the experimental data, as is evident from the large
  residual random errors in those parameters.  Therefore, Occam's
  razor does not significantly penalise this model, relative to the
  simpler model with the Weiss fields fixed at zero.
\item{}The spin polarization produced by the cobalt's Weiss field, as
  estimated in traditional fashion, is of a similar order of magnitude
  ($\sim{}10\%$) to that found by other workers in various independent
  laboratories, using polarized electron reflection from other
  ferro-magnetic transition metals (section
  \ref{experimental-context}.)
\item{}There is some strong evidence that the stray magnetic field of
  the sample (or of some part of the sample holder) is significantly
  affecting the electron trajectories, creating a
  magnetization-dependent systematic error in the measured electron
  arrival rates at the Mott polarimeter's detectors.
\end{enumerate}

The genuine effect of the cobalt's Weiss field can be detected, even
in the presence of the systematic error due to stray magnetic fields,
because the two have significantly different signatures in the
electron arrival rates at the channeltrons.  When the sample
magnetization is reversed, the characteristic behaviour caused by the
stray-field systematic error is for the electron arrival rates, at the
two channeltrons, to change by the same factor, in the same sense,
i.e.~either both increase, or both decrease.  The characteristic
behaviour caused by a genuine spin polarization, produced by the
cobalt's Weiss field, on the other hand, is for the electron arrival
rates, at the two channeltrons, to change by the same factor, in
opposite senses, i.e.~one increases and the other decreases.  It was
also this dissimilarity in signatures that allowed the systematic
error to be noticed in the first place (table
\ref{movement-directions}.)

In physical terms, the various methods used to analyse the data,
namely the least-squares curve fitting of chapter \ref{results}, the
asymmetry estimation of section \ref{traditional-estimation-section},
and the Bayesian inference of section \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}
are all seeking the same effect, notwithstanding their substantial
differences of statistical approach.  All of them are testing for the
electron arrival rates changing, on sample magnetization reversal, by
the same factor in opposite senses.  All of them are, therefore,
sensitive to genuine spin polarizations, rather than to the
stray-field systematic error, and all of them declare decisively that
they have found such polarizations.

Of course, it is possible for both a genuine polarization and a stray
field to occur simultaneously, and for their effects to be
superimposed on one another.  This appears to be the case in the
experiments discussed in the present thesis.  In this case, the
systematic error in the electron arrival rates, caused by the stray
field, has the following two effects.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Quantitative estimation of the polarizations, and therefore of
  the electro-magnetic parameters of the sample, by any of the data
  processing methods, is rather imprecise, i.e.~has a large random
  error; however, this effect does not dominate the standard deviation
  random errors found in the estimates of electro-magnetic parameters,
  the bulk of which result from the double-valued nature of equation
  \ref{polarization}, when inverted to give electro-magnetic parameters
  as a function of spin polarization.
\item{}Visual inspection of the electron arrival rate data cannot
  easily pick out the individual effects (genuine spin polarization
  and stray field) from the superposition of the two.
\end{enumerate}

It would, therefore, be much better if a way were found to eliminate
the stray field, both to make the essential physical process of spin
polarization by the exchange interaction more obvious visually, and to
improve quantitative estimation of the Weiss field involved.  Lind
\cite{Lind:1987:SSG} found such a method for his particular
experimental configuration, which involved following the field applied
to magnetize the sample with a smaller applied field, in the opposite
direction.  It is, however, unclear how Lind determined that this
method was a success, what physical mechanism allows the technique to
work, and whether it will be applicable to experimental apparatus
other than Lind's, such as the apparatus used for the present thesis.

Having drawn conclusions from the experimental results hereinbefore
presented, some suggestions will now be given as to future research
directions related to the work in this thesis.

\section{Suggestions for Further Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item{}It would be intriguing to attempt to repeat Lind's
  \cite{Lind:1987:SSG} method of eliminating the stray-field
  systematic error, by following the applied field used to set the
  sample magnetization direction with a smaller applied field in the
  opposite direction.  As well as experimental reproduction of the
  technique, some theorizing would be in order, in the hope of
  understanding the physical mechanisms behind it.
\item{}As a complement to attempts to eliminate the spatial deflection
  of the electron beam by a stray field from the sample or sample
  holder, there may be benefits in attempting to use this spatial
  deflection, along with spatially-resolved detection of the reflected
  beam, as an alternative means of determining a sample's magnetic
  state using an electron beam.
\item{}The numerical method, presented in this thesis, for obtaining
  summary data about the Bayesian posterior probability distributions,
  given the experimental data presented here, has performed
  disappointingly: it was very slow to run, taking CPU time of the
  order of a month to reach the conclusions presented here, and even
  after this time, there remains some doubt over whether it has
  reached a final conclusion on the marginal likelihoods used for
  model comparison, given that the likelihood function may not vary
  smoothly in parameter space.  The slowness is in large part due to
  the many extra adjustable parameters, which have had to be inserted
  into the physical models, to handle the systematic errors now
  attributed to stray magnetic fields, and experimental techniques
  that eliminate these errors may resolve the problems with the
  numerical method.  Nevertheless, there may be benefits in exploring
  alternative numerical methods, particularly if it is possible to
  increase the simplicity of their implementation by using adaptations
  of widely-available fitting software, rather than having to program
  a Markov chain Monte Carlo method anew; since completing the
  analysis herein presented, the author has, in the course of a
  separate experimental project, made considerable progress in
  devising means whereby, with a little algebra, ubiquitous
  chi-squared fitting routines can be used for Bayesian parameter
  estimation and model comparison.
\item{}It will soon be necessary to consider what kinds of samples it
  is most interesting to examine with the polarized electron
  reflection technique; the $Co/Cu(001)$ structure considered in this
  thesis was chosen primarily as a trial system, for development of
  the instrumentation.  Above, the $c(2\times{}2)$ surface alloy of
  manganese on a cobalt $(001)$ surface, with a copper substrate, was
  also mentioned as a candidate system for examination by polarized
  electron reflection.  The author would characterize the motivation
  for experiments on this alloy as aesthetic: the wish to peer deeper
  into a beautiful and unusual system.  The author has discussed with
  colleagues a number of other combinations of copper, cobalt, and
  manganese, which hold similar interest.  However, as has been
  discussed elsewhere \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, the author now takes the
  view that the scientific value of experimental results stems
  primarily not from their aesthetic appeal, but from their ability to
  help policy-makers reach better decisions.  In the case of research
  in magnetic film structures, the most relevant policy-makers are
  managers in the magnetic data storage industry, and the most
  relevant decisions are those about which systems of magnetic
  materials to include in future hard discs, read heads, and magnetic
  random access memories.  The author believes that the time is ripe
  to consult managers in this industry about how they can use
  information about the Weiss fields of materials in multi-layer
  structures, and what multi-layer structures are most important to
  them.

reflection coefficient in the classical-field theory's reflection
coefficient is, to a very good approximation, independent of angle of
incidence; therefore, it is unsurprising that the predictions are
indistinguishable from those of a model with a reflection coefficient
exactly independent of angle of incidence.  There would be little
point in attempting to extend the experiment into the grazing angles
of incidence, because, in this region, the component of the electron
motion perpendicular to the sample surface is tiny, nullifying the
classical-field theory's fundamental assumption that the kinetic
energy associated with this component of the electron motion is much
larger than the potential energy step at the surface.  This also
absolves us of the need to worry about the ``un-physical''
singularities; they are, in any case, outside the domain of validity
of the theory.

Although bulk cobalt is a hexagonal close packed metal at room
temperature and pressure, thin cobalt films, grown by molecular beam
epitaxy on $Cu(001)$, adopt \cite{Smardz:1990:RTF, Schmid:1993:FIT,
Ramsperger:1996:GSF} the face-centred cubic structure of the copper;
this epitaxial structure requires \cite{Weber:1996:SRM} some elastic
strain in the cobalt, and breaks down \cite{Weber:1996:SRM,
Bland:1998:ASE} for large thicknesses\footnote{In this section, the
common convention of giving thicknesses in mono-layers is followed,
whereas elsewhere in this thesis, thicknesses are given in units
related to the metre.  From comments in ``Magnetic Anisotropies of
Ultrathin $Co(001)$ Films on $Cu(001)$'' \cite{Krams:1992:MAU}, one
can calculate that, for $Co/Cu(001)$, $1\ut{ML} =
(166\pm{}36)\ut{pm}$, whereas other workers \cite{Weber:1996:MIO,
Weber:1996:OMA, Weber:1996:SRM} state that $1\ut{ML} \approx{}
180\ut{pm}$.}, as it becomes energetically favourable to form
dislocations to relieve the strain; the boundary of ``large
thicknesses'' is \cite{Heinrich:1993:UMM} not thinner than

a spin polarization of zero to an ``asymmetry'' of $\sim{}0.19$.  It
is not clear whether this ``asymmetry'' represents an absolute
polarization, or whether it requires calibration with something akin

dependence is the non-ferro-magnetic nature of bulk copper, which would
lead one to expect a zero polarization from the zero-thickness film.
Intriguingly, the measured polarizations from the zero-thickness film
appear to depart from zero.  It is not clear whether this is
indicative of some localized magnetization at the surface of the
copper, or of a systematic error in the measured results, such as
that, discussed above, which may be introduced by the use of a
non-linear, and therefore potentially biased, polarization estimator,

error will arise.  Evaluating the integral, to quantify the size of
this systematic error, is beyond the author's analytical capabilities;
it could be integrated numerically, but this would sacrifice the

examining this estimator.  This is what justifies turning to

range of parameter values.  This is, as discussed above (section
\ref{further-conclusions},) precisely the situation encountered with
the experiments and models central to this thesis.  Bayesian methods
implement \cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} Occam's razor
automatically, by comparing models' average likelihoods over all
values of their parameters (known as marginal likelihoods,) weighted
according to the pre-experiment plausibility function encoded in the
prior probability distribution, instead of comparing their maximum
likelihoods; this directly penalises \cite{MacKay:1992:BI,
MacKay:1992:BMA} models for fine-tuning their parameters, not for
merely having parameters to fine-tune.

  algorithm, encodes only the goodness of fit of the model to the data
  as a function of the adjustable parameters.  In Bayesian statistics,
  this is only half the story of parameter estimation; to obtain a
  Bayesian ``belief function'' of the parameters, representing how
  strongly one believes in each conceivable set of parameter values,
  given the experimental results (this belief function is known as the
  posterior probability distribution,) the likelihood must be
  modulated by a plausibility function, or prior probability
  distribution, describing the level of credence one gives to each
  conceivable set of parameters before undertaking the experiment.
  Using the output of the least-squares algorithm directly for
  parameter estimation would be equivalent to an implicit, fixed
  assumption that the prior probability distribution is uniform over
  parameter space.  Elsewhere \cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}, the author has
  expressed concern over the philosophical consequences of prior
  probability distributions being implicit and fixed.  Here, it is
  possible to be more pragmatic, simply noting that for many
  parameters, a uniform prior probability distribution is
  inappropriate: for example, the parameter might be a quantum
  efficiency, in which case it makes sense to give it a non-zero prior
  probability density for parameter values between zero and one, and a
  zero prior probability density outside this domain; alternatively,
  standard data tables might give an estimate and uncertainty for the
  parameter, based on previous experimental evidence, which could be
  well represented by a Gaussian prior probability distribution.  This
  problem is also likely to be surmountable: since completing the
  analysis of the data presented in this thesis, the author has, in
  the course of a separate experimental project, examined the
  possibility of transforming a parameter $a$, over which a prior
  probability distribution $P(a)$ is required, to a parameter $b$,
  which is a function of $a$, such that $P(a)\td{a} = \td{b}$,
  i.e.~the prior probability distribution over $b$ is uniform, and $b$
  can be used as a fitting parameter in a least-squares algorithm; it
  transpires that, for the common forms of $P(a)$ that the author has
  examined to date, the differential equation has a ready analytical
  solution, providing a simple formula to transform between $a$ and
  $b$.  Nevertheless, this introduces extra complication in
  configuring a standard fitting program, which slightly undermines
  the case in terms of simplicity for using a standard program.

from Brillouin light scattering experiments.  In reality, the use of
laterally homogeneous models does not imply any assumption about the
configuration of the film structure or its domain structure; this
study is concerned with the specular reflection, which is the
scattered beam, the in-plane component of whose wave-vector is the
same as the in-plane component of wave-vector of the incident beam.
In the general theory of scattering of matter waves by a potential, a
scattered beam whose in-plane wave-vector component differs from that
of the incident beam by $\vc{k}$ results from the Fourier component of
the scattering potential with in-plane wave-vector $\vc{k}$:
specifically, the specularly reflected beam results from the average
value of the potential, over the area of the sample covered by the
incident beam, and is unaffected by variations in the scattering
potential, such as domain structure, which are encoded in the Fourier
components of the scattering potential with non-zero in-plane wave
vectors, the effects of which appear only in the diffraction orders.
Of course, if there are domains of varying magnetization directions,
within the region illuminated by the incident beam, then the average
Weiss field detected by polarized electron reflection will be smaller
than the saturation Weiss field within a single domain, but the
situation is still within the capability of this theory to handle.

  \ref{place-sample}, in a position that had previously been
  determined, by visual inspection, to allow an electromagnet

  \cite{Hope:1997:SPR} to a field of several hundred Gauss, was passed
  through the electromagnet for $(10\pm{}2)\ut{s}$.  The sign of the

  had been performed previously, the channeltron chosen was the one
  that had not been chosen at the same stage in the preceding

\section[Single Channeltron]{Procedure for Conducting Polarized
  Electron Measurements with One Channeltron}
\label{per-1-channeltron}

The purpose of this procedure is to obtain measurements of the
electron arrival rate at the channeltron as a function of the incident
beam energy, with a variable direction of variation of the beam
energy, to protect against drift effects.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The electron gun's beam energy $E_b$ was set to
  $(500\pm{}0.3)\ut{eV}$, with corresponding adjustments (table
  \ref{polarimeter-voltages}) in the voltages on the polarimeter's
  front grid, thorium foil, and retarding grids.
\item{}The dwell time $\tau$ of the data acquisition apparatus
  (chapter \ref{compact}) was set to $1\ut{s}$.  The reasons for
  choosing this dwell time are discussed in section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments}.
\item{}The electron gun's beam current $F$ was set to
  $(4\pm{}0.1)\ut{\mu{}A}$.
\item{}A series of electron arrival rate measurements was taken,
  according to the procedure in section \ref{per-1-current}.
\item{}$\tau$ was set to $50\ut{ms}$.  The reasons for choosing this
  dwell time are discussed in section \ref{july-2002-experiments}.
\item{}Either an ascending or a descending order was chosen for
  incident beam energies $E_b$.  If the procedure being described here
  had been performed previously, then the order chosen was opposite to
  that chosen in the preceding performance of the procedure.
  Otherwise, an order was chosen at random.
\item{}The electron gun beam energy, along with the voltages on the
  polarimeter's front grid, thorium foil, and retarding grids, was
  varied, in the chosen order, in $50\ut{eV}$ steps between
  $500\ut{eV}$ and $1\ut{keV}$ inclusive, with a random error of
  $300\ut{meV}$ in each beam energy.
\item{}At each of the beam energies, a series of electron arrival rate
  measurements was taken, according to the procedure in section
  \ref{per-1-energy}.
\end{enumerate}

\section[Single Beam Energy]{Procedure for Conducting Polarized
  Electron Reflection Measurements at One Beam Energy}
\label{per-1-energy}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Either an ascending or a descending order was chosen for
  incident beam currents $F$.  If the procedure being described here
  had been performed previously, then the order chosen was opposite to
  that chosen in the preceding performance of the procedure.
  Otherwise, an order was chosen at random.
\item{}The electron gun beam current was varied, in the chosen order,
  in $2\ut{\mu{}A}$ steps between $2\ut{\mu{}A}$ and $6\ut{\mu{}A}$.
\item{}At each of the beam currents, a series of electron arrival rate
  measurements was taken, according to the procedure in section
  \ref{per-1-current}.
\end{enumerate}

\section[Single Beam Current]{Procedure for Conducting Polarized
  Electron Reflection Measurements at One Beam Current}
\label{per-1-current}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}In each of 256 consecutive periods of $\tau{}$, the number of
  electrons detected at the relevant channeltron was recorded; $\tau$
  is a controllable parameter in the logging software, known as the
  dwell time.  Its values for each of the individual performances for
  this procedure are specified above.

\cite{Krams:1992:MAU} that the permanent magnetization in $Co/Cu(001)$
is in-plane.  The existence of sudden steps in electrostatic potential
is supported by a comment in \emph{Calculated Electronic Properties of
  Metals} \cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP}, although this book is concerned
primarily with bulk materials, and there is the possibility that
steps, which are sudden on the scale of bulk materials, may be gradual
on the scale of electron de Broglie wavelengths.  I suspect that such
a possibility would be easily detectable in the experiments, because
there would be no reflection without a sudden potential step.

Having presented and discussed the results of them main experiments,
it is now time to present results of some similar, earlier

\section{Intermediate Experiment 1}
\label{autumn-2001-experiments}
d3316 123

A preliminary experiment, related to this thesis, was described in
\emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
\cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  That report presents Mott asymmetries of
reflected electron beams from a $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ structure, using
the estimator of equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}.
Those measurements are of much lower precision than the measurements
presented in this thesis (chapter \ref{results}, section
\ref{traditional-estimation-section},) and the report remains of
interest primarily for its list of the adaptations that were made to
the polarimeter, and to the measurement technique, in order to bring
it into a sufficiently functional condition to undertake the
preliminary experiment.  That list is repeated in section
\ref{repeated-adaptation-list} of this thesis.  Similarly, this
section, and section \ref{july-2002-experiments}, are concerned with
the polarimetry measurements that were performed after the preliminary
experiment, and before the main experiment of part
\ref{main-experiment}, the technical adaptations that were discovered
to be necessary, as a result of those intermediate measurements, and
the implementation of those adaptations.
d3440 27
a3466 11
After the preliminary experiment, considerable resources were devoted
to equipment repairs, and to safety-related upgrades, which did not
constitute adaptations of the polarimeter, or of the measurement
technique.  Once this was done, concerted efforts began to produce
more decisive polarized electron reflection measurements than those in
that report, starting with pilot experiments on $Co/Cu(001)$
structures, without the added manganese; compared with most of the
preliminary measurements, lower beam energies were used in the
intermediate experiments, leading to more intense reflected beams, and
greater precision in the current (or electron arrival rate)
measurements at the channeltrons.
d3468 111
a3578 121
In the first such intermediate experiment, the method was very similar
to that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences
being that the channeltrons were used as Faraday cups, measuring
continuous currents, instead of counting individual electrons, and
that the position of the sample was only set to a precision of
$1\ut{mm}$ in translational degrees of freedom, and $1^{\circ}$ in the
rotational degree of freedom with the vertical rotation axis.  Some of
the results are displayed in table \ref{intthick1} and figures

In addition to the polarized electron reflection measurements, Auger
electron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction were used
for structural characterization of some of these samples.  They
revealed that the copper surfaces produced by a sputtering and
annealing process of similar extent to that in chapter \ref{results}
were clean and well ordered, and that a significant amount of cobalt
was being deposited.
d3597 2
a3598 32
A number of features of the data stand out.  Firstly, instead of being
downward sloping and convex $\cup$, the electron arrival rate as a
function of beam energy is upward sloping and concave $\cap$.  After
independent tests of the voltage arriving at the retarding grids
(figure \ref{sd},) this was attributed to the power supply in use for
the retarding grids having the wrong polarity to maintain a constant
energy loss window, resulting in an energy loss window that increased
at twice the rate of increase of the incident beam energy, and a
$\Gamma$ (figure \ref{HER_Average}) that increased with increasing
incident beam energy.  A new power supply, with the correct polarity,
was procured for the experiments described in section
\ref{july-2002-experiments} and section \ref{method}.  Secondly,
the electron arrival rate for a given set of conditions was not
reproduce-able, as is vividly displayed in the histograms of the
detector current, which are clearly multi-modal.  After independent
tests of the current arriving at a given detector, as the sample
position was varied, this was attributed to the variation in position
of the sample between different measurements, and a corresponding
variation in the fraction of the specularly reflected beam that was
accepted at the front of the polarimeter.  Fortunately, the same tests
indicated that a precision of $0.1\ut{mm}$ in the translational
degrees of freedom, and $0.1^{\circ}$ in the rotation about the
vertical axis, which was feasible with the available equipment (figure
\ref{holder},) would be adequate to render this effect negligible.
Thirdly, at the low incident beam energies, where the energy loss
window was in the region where $S$ is large enough to provide spin
sensitivity (figure \ref{HER_Sherman},) $\Gamma$ was so small as to
stretch the limits of the sensitivity of continuous current
measurements.  For subsequent experiments (section
\ref{july-2002-experiments}, section \ref{method},) therefore, a move
was made to single electron counting.  To succeed in this move
required the procurement and installation of new channeltrons.

In the second intermediate experiment, the method was very similar to
that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences being
that longer dwell times were used, and more electron counts were
recorded, resulting in an experiment that lasted around $17\ut{hours}$
for each film thickness, rather than the $2\ut{hours}$ or so of the
experiment in part \ref{main-experiment}.  Some of the results are

In addition to the polarized electron reflection experiments, one of
the author's colleagues confirmed using MOKE measurements that the
films on substrates 5 and 7 were ferromagnetic \cite{Kopper:2002:ESP}.

In many cases, the electron arrival rate appears not to be a smooth
function of the incident beam energy.  Inspection of the detailed data
sets, based on the counts in single periods of $\tau$, rather than of
$256\tau$, reveals that this is associated with a gradual variation in
time of the count rate, for fixed conditions\footnote{These detailed
  data sets are available in the transparent copy of this thesis, in
  the files whose names contain the word ``detailed.''}.  The
variations are tentatively attributed to drift in the detection
efficiencies of the channeltrons, and have an amplitude of
approximately $10\%$ of the average sensitivity peak-to-peak, on a
time-scale of the order of a few hours.  This is the reason for much
faster experiments being used in part \ref{main-experiment}.

\section[Further Discussion and Conclusions]{Further Discussion of,
and Conclusions from, the Experimental Results}
\label{relegated-bayesian-stuff}

Above, several references have been made to a Bayesian inference
process, for drawing conclusions about sample characteristics from the
experimental results.  In this section, that Bayesian inference
process is presented.

\subsection{Statistical Inference Process}
\label{adaptive-models}

In this section, the data presented in chapter \ref{results} will be
used to estimate the values of the adjustable parameters in two models
of the system of samples and measuring apparatus, and to compare the
two models.  The framework used for this data interpretation will be
Bayesian inference \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP, Howson:1989:SRB,
MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA, MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI}.
The details of the inference method are presented in section
\ref{inference-method-details}.

\subsubsection{Framework of the Models}
\label{framework}

Both models are based on the new theory of polarized electron
reflection from a bulk sample presented in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}.  The use of a model intended for a bulk
sample is justified on the basis that the inelastic mean free path of
electrons, of the energies used in this experiment, is
\cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF} no more than $\sim{}1\ut{nm}$,
with the result that even rather thin films will appear, when examined
with an electron beam, to be bulk materials.

Therefore, when the beam current into the electron gun is $F$, the
rate of electron incidence on the sample is $F/e$, and the rate of
electrons leaving the sample, in the reflected beam (figure \ref{sd},)
is, from integration of equation \ref{reflected-amplitude},
\begin{equation}
\label{reflected-intensity}
G = \left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4vI}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The polarization of the reflected beam is, from equation
\ref{polarization},
\begin{equation}
P = -\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The electrostatic potential, $V$, and the magnetic flux density, $B$,
in the sample, are adjustable parameters of the ``main'' model, while
in the ``null'' model, only $V$ is adjustable, $B$ being fixed at
zero.  In fact, since there are eight cobalt film thicknesses,
including zero thickness (table \ref{recorded-growth-conditions},)
there are multiple parameters of this type, $V_j$ and $B_j$, with the
film thicknesses indexed by integers $j$, from $0$ to $7$ inclusive;
for thickness $0$, $B_0$ is fixed at zero even for the ``main'' model.
These then lead to electron leaving rates $G_j$ and reflected
polarizations $P_j$.

Since the entrance hole of the polarimeter (figure \ref{sd}) is of
finite width, it is possible that not all of the electrons in the
reflected beam will enter the polarimeter.  Therefore, an acceptance
probability $a$ is defined, so that the rate of electrons entering the
polarimeter is $aG_j$.  The entrance hole and grids are assumed to be
non-polarizing, with the result that the polarization of the beam
entering the polarimeter is $P_j$.

The thorium foil then scatters electrons towards the two channeltrons.
The rate of electron arrival at channeltron $1$ will be, by equation
\ref{r1},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(1, j)} = \Gamma{}(1+SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and that at channeltron $2$ will be, by equation \ref{r2},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(2, j)} = \Gamma{}(1-SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where the spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma$ and the
Sherman function $S$ are characteristics of the thorium foil.
Calibration values of $\Gamma$ and $S$ for a Mott polarimeter, of
identical design to that used for these experiments, have been
provided by other workers \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}, and those for
electrons with energy $20\ut{keV}$ are reproduced in figures
\ref{HER_Average} and \ref{HER_Sherman}.  Although the energy of the
electrons on striking the thorium foil, in the experiments presented
in this thesis, is $(20.5\pm{}0.00725)\ut{keV}$, not $20\ut{keV}$, the
systematic error introduced by this energy difference
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} is negligible, compared with the quantization
error of the author's readings from the published graphs (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood}.)
\begin{figure}

\caption{Graph of spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma$ against energy
  loss window $W$, from the calibration data for the compact
  retarding-potential Mott polarimeter, provided in ``High-efficiency
  retarding-potential Mott polarization analyzer''
  \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}.  The error bars represent the standard
  deviations associated with the quantization of the author's readings
  from the published graph.}

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}

\caption{Graph of Sherman function $S$ against energy
  loss window $W$, from the calibration data for the compact

  \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}.  The error bars represent the sums in
  quadrature of the standard deviation associated with the
  quantization of the author's readings from the published graph, and
  the error quoted on the published graph.}
\label{HER_Sherman}
\end{figure}

The published calibration data are for electron energies, on striking
the thorium foil, of $20\ut{keV}$ and $25\ut{keV}$, and are presented
as a function of the energy loss window $W$, defined by the potential
at the retarding grids (chapter \ref{compact}.)  The author has chosen
to include the published data for a $20\ut{keV}$ energy, on striking
the thorium foil, in the data set (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood},) from which inference is to proceed, and
to characterize the thorium foil by by twelve adjustable parameters,
$\Gamma_k$ and $S_k$, where $k$ runs through integers from $0$ to $5$
inclusive,
\begin{equation}
\label{Gammamodel}
\Gamma = \sum_{k=0}^5\Gamma_kW^k\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{Smodel}
S = \sum_{k=0}^5S_kW^k\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

These fifth order Taylor expansions are an extension, to calibration
data that include relatively large energy loss windows, of the spirit
of the first and second order Taylor expansions in ``Use of thorium as
a target in electron-spin analyzers'' \cite{McClelland:1989:UTT}.  The
fifth order has been chosen to provide a number of adjustable
parameters, in each Taylor expansion, that is the largest integer less
than or equal to half the number of calibration data points, in line
with MacKay's \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} recommendation
for the number of parameters in neural network models.

Channeltron $i$ (figure \ref{channeltron},) used in single-electron
counting mode in these experiments, has a detection efficiency
$\eta_i$, adjusted by a time-dependent perturbation $p_{ij}$ to allow
for drift (section \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)  Since the speed of
the present experiments has been chosen so that the drift should not
be significant within the time-scale of measurements on a single film
thickness, each channeltron has just one $p_{ij}$ value for each film
thickness; the subscript $j$, as before, indexes the film thickness.
Therefore, the electron detection rate at the channeltron $i$, from
film thickness $j$, is predicted to be
\begin{equation}
\label{predicted-detection-rate}
f_p^{(i, j)} = p_{ij}\eta_if_a^{(i, j)}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The $p_{ij}$ and $\eta_i$ values are further adjustable parameters of
the model.

\item{}The posterior probability of the null model, in which cobalt
  ferro-magnetism is not detected, is estimated at
  \input{null-posterior}, and that of the main model, in which cobalt
  ferro-magnetism is detected, at \input{main-posterior}.  However,
  these estimates should be treated with scepticism.
\end{enumerate}

At first glance, the precision of the inferred electrostatic
potentials and magnetic flux densities appears a rather unimpressive
return on the experimental effort involved in obtaining the
measurements.  In addition, a comparison (tables \ref{null-compare},
\ref{main-compare}) of the beliefs held about all of the parameters,
including those concerned with instrumental calibration and with
transient instrumental characteristics, before and after the data in
chapter \ref{results}, along with the published calibration data
(figures \ref{HER_Average}, \ref{HER_Sherman},) have been taken into
account, shows a broadening, rather than the narrowing that one might
expect, of the probability distribution over the parameter set, due to
the data.

However, the very decisive choice of the better model supplies a
greater reward.

\subsection{The Details of the Inference Method}
\label{inference-method-details}
\subsubsection{Standard Probability Distributions}

In this process, definitions of some standard probability density
distributions will be useful.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The Dirac delta function is such that
\begin{equation}
\delta{}(x) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for $x \neq{} 0$, and
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}\delta{}(x)\td{x} = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for any $\epsilon > 0$.  This probability distribution expresses the
certainty that $x = 0$.
\item{}The Gaussian probability distribution is
\begin{equation}
G(x; \mu{}, \sigma{}) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{}\left(-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This probability distribution is a standard default, much beloved
\cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} of the physics community, for
the distribution over a parameter $x$, knowledge of which can be
summarized by an expected value $\mu$ and a degree of variation
$\sigma$ about the expected value.
\item{}A perfect top-hat function is
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = \frac{1}{h-l}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
otherwise.  This probability distribution expresses the certainty that
a parameter $x$ lies between $l$ and $h$, and has equal probability of
lying in any fixed-width subset of that domain.  It is useful, for
example, where $x$ is a probability, and therefore must lie between
$0$ and $1$, or where $x$ is a measurement, quantized in units $h-l$
with an unknown origin by a digital meter, of a parameter
$\frac{h+l}{2}$.  In the rest of this section, an adapted version of
the perfect top-hat
\begin{equation}
T(x; l, h)\frac{127}{128(h-l)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
\begin{equation}
T(x; l, h) = G\left(x; \frac{h+l}{2}, \frac{h-l}{5.32}\right)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
otherwise, is used.  This distribution has a probability
$\frac{127}{128}$ of being in the top-hat region, and a probability
density outside this region equal to a Gaussian of appropriate width
\cite{Manura:2002:M, ::ESH} for the probability integrated over this
region to be $\frac{1}{128}$.  Not only is this a more realistic
belief density than a perfect top-hat, it provides a probability
density gradient outside the top-hat region, which will help the
leapfrog proposal density (section \ref{monte-carlo}) to reduce the
random walk behaviour of the metropolis method.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Prior Probability Distributions}
\label{discussion-prior}

Bayesian estimation of the parameters in a model, on the basis of
experimental data, requires \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP, MacKay:1992:BI,
MacKay:1992:BMA} the explicit statement of prior probability
distributions, representing the beliefs that are held about the
parameters, before the experimental data are examined.  The author has
made some remarks about the importance of this requirement elsewhere
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR}.  The prior probability distributions for this
problem are presented in tables \ref{priortable} and
\ref{priortable2}.

\caption{Parameters in the Main Model, with Their Prior Probability

\label{priortable2}
\end{sidewaystable}

Justifications for these prior probability distributions follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}For the acceptance probability $a$, a uniform distribution over
  the range from $0$ to $1$ seems sensible, given that we know very
  little about the properties of this system, other than that the
  energy loss window at the front of the polarimeter is (table
  \ref{polarimeter-voltages}) held constant throughout the
  experiments.
\item{}The author and collaborators performed (section
  \ref{july-2002-experiments}) experiments, before those described
  here, which provided a rough estimate of the extent of the drift in
  the channeltron detection efficiencies.  The magnitude of the drift
  was found to be $\sim{}10\%$ peak-to-peak, on a typical time-scale
  of the order of a few hours.  The time-scale is represented in the
  division of the data set into chronologically contiguous subsets,
  which, by the design of the present experiment, coincide with single
  film thicknesses, and the magnitude in the standard deviation of the
  prior probability distributions over the time-dependent
  perturbations $p_{ij}$.
\item{}The scattering probability $\Gamma$ at the thorium foil must be
  in the range between zero and one, leading to the top-hat form for
  the distribution over $\Gamma_0$.
\item{} In the distributions over $\Gamma_k$, $k > 0$, the typical
  range of variation of the scattering probability over the energy
  scale of the experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor
  expansion, is asserted to be one.
\item{}The Sherman function $S$ at the thorium foil must be in the
  range between $-1$ and one, leading to the top-hat form for the
  distribution over $S_0$.
\item{}In the distributions over $S_k$, $k > 0$, the typical range of
  variation of the Sherman function over the energy scale of the
  experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor expansion, is
  asserted to be two.
\item{}Because the front ends of the channeltrons are earthed, the
  electrons reach them with the same kinetic energy that they have at
  the sample.  This means that the energies of the electrons, on
  arrival at the channeltrons, will range from $250\ut{eV}$ to
  $1500\ut{eV}$.  The detection efficiencies of channeltrons of the
  type used, in this energy range, are \cite{::CEM} between $0.78$ and
  $0.89$.  Therefore, a top-hat probability distribution, with these
  as its limits, is used for $\eta_i$.  The author does not believe
  that it is worthwhile to create an energy-dependent model, since the
  uncertainty in the efficiency, at a particular energy, is
  \cite{Bordoni:1971:CEM, ::CEM} comparable with its variation with
  energy, over this range.
\item{}It can be assumed that, in as much as the sample is believed to
  be bulk, the bulk material in question is, for $j > 0$, cobalt, or,
  for the clean sample $j = 0$, copper, because the meaning of
  ``bulk'' is ``topmost layer too thick for the electron beam to
  penetrate,'' i.e.  of a thickness that is large compared with 1nm
  \cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF}.  Therefore, the
  electrostatic potential $V_j$ is expected to be the difference in
  expected work function between stainless steel, which is the
  material from which the front end of the electron gun, which sets
  the zero of potential for the electrons, is constructed, and copper
  for $j = 0$, or cobalt for other film thickness indices $j$.  The
  width of the distribution of $V_j$ can be estimated by combining in
  quadrature the random errors $\Delta\Phi_l = 0.05\Phi_l$
  \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} in measured work functions for the
  materials.  The work functions are $\Phi_{SS} = 4.1\ut{V}$ for
  stainless steel \cite{:2001:KPF}, $\Phi_{Cu} = 4.65\ut{V}$ for
  copper \cite{:2001:PTE}, and $\Phi_{Co} = 5\ut{V}$ for cobalt
  \cite{:2001:PTE}.
\item{}For the copper surface $j = 0$ in the main model, and for all
  film thickness indices $j$ in the null model, there are assumed to
  be no magnetic effects; the magnetic flux densities $B_j$ acting on
  the electrons, in these cases, are certainly zero.
\item{}The magnetic flux density $B_j$ that affects the electrons is
  expected to be the same effective field, originating in the exchange
  interaction \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE}, which creates
  ferro-magnetism.  For the samples with a cobalt surface, $j > 0$, in
  the main model, a prior expectation of zero will be used, with the
  width of the prior probability distribution, i.e. the typical size
  of the flux density, being given by the order-of-magnitude estimate
  $\frac{k_Bm_eT_c}{e\hbar}$ of the strength of this Weiss field that
  can \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} be obtained from the Curie temperature
  $T_C$.  This is the only difference between the null and main
  models.
\end{itemize}

The parameters are taken, a priori, to be independent.  Therefore, the
prior probability density of the parameter vector
\begin{eqnarray}
\vc{Q} & = & (Q_1,Q_2,\ldots{},Q_{47})\br
& = &
(a,p_{10},\ldots{},p_{17},p_{20},\ldots{},p_{27},\Gamma_0,\ldots{},\Gamma_5,S_0,\ldots{},S_5,\eta_1,\eta_2,\br
& & V_0,\ldots{},V_7,B_0,\ldots{},B_7)
\end{eqnarray}
is
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\vc{Q}|M_n) & = & \prod_{m=1}^{47}P(Q_m|M_n)\br
& = &
P(a|M_n)\left(\prod_{i=1}^2\prod_{j=0}^7P(p_{ij}|M_n)P(\eta_i|M_n)P(V_j|M_n)P(B_j|M_n)\right)\br
& & \times\left(\prod_{k=0}^5P(\Gamma_k|M_n)P(S_k|M_n)\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

There are also prior probabilities of each model, with any set of
parameter values.  These are taken to be
\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_N) & = & P(M_M)\br
& = & \frac{1}{2}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{The Likelihood}
\label{discussion-likelihood}

The data set $D$ is the disjunction of the set $D_0$ of results of the
present experiments (chapter \ref{results},) the set $D_{\Gamma}$ of
published $\Gamma$ calibration data (figure \ref{HER_Average},) and
the set $D_S$ of published $S$ calibration data (figure
\ref{HER_Sherman}.)

For each measured electron arrival rate $f_m^{(i, j)} \in{} D_0$, the
expectation of $f_m^{(i, j)}$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$,
is $f_p^{(i, j)}$ (equation \ref{predicted-detection-rate},)
calculated using parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, and the values of $E_b$
and $F$ pertaining to the data point in question.  There are two
known, significant sources of uncertainty in this prediction.  The
first results from the Poisson process \cite{Boas:1983:MMP} of
discrete electron arrivals at the channeltron, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}}$, where $256\tau$ is the time interval, over
which electrons are counted to obtain the arrival rate $f_m^{i, j}$.
The second results from the standard deviation uncertainty
$\Delta{}F$, in the incident beam current $F$, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\frac{f_p^{(i,
    j)}\Delta{}F}{F}$.  These are combined in quadrature to give an
overall standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i, j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}$.  The
likelihood function is then taken to be
\begin{equation}
P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q}) = G\left(f_m^{(i, j)}; f_p^{(i, j)},
  \sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i,
        j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_0|\vc{Q}) = \prod_{f_m^{(i, j)}\in{}D_0}P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma_E \in{}
D_{\Gamma}$, the expectation of $\Gamma_E$, with a given parameter
vector $\vc{Q}$, is $\Gamma$ (equation \ref{Gammamodel},) calculated
using the $\Gamma_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value of $W$ relevant to
$\Gamma_E$.  The uncertainty is introduced by the quantization, in
units of $q_{\Gamma} = 0.001$, of the author's readings from the
published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs.  This gives
\begin{equation}
P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q}) = T\left(\Gamma_E; \Gamma{}-\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2},
  \Gamma{}+\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_{\Gamma}|\vc{Q}) =
\prod_{\Gamma_E\in{}D_{\Gamma}}P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured Sherman function $S_E \in{} D_S$, the expectation of
$S_E$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, is $S$ (equation
\ref{Smodel},) calculated using the $S_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value
of $W$ relevant to $S_E$.  As well as the published
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} uncertainty $\Delta{}S_E$, uncertainty is
introduced by the quantization, in units of $q_S = 0.025$, of the
author's readings from the published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs:
the standard deviation associated with this is
$\frac{q_S}{\sqrt{12}}$.  These are combined in quadrature, to give a
standard deviation $\sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}$.  The
likelihood is then taken to be
\begin{equation}
P(S_E|\vc{Q}) = G\left(S_E; S,
  \sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_S|\vc{Q}) =
\prod_{S_E\in{}D_S}P(S_E|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For a given parameter vector, the three data sets are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D|\vc{Q}) = P(D_0|\vc{Q})P(D_{\Gamma}|\vc{Q})P(D_S|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Posterior Probability Distribution}
\label{discussion-posterior}

The posterior probability distribution over the parameters in the null
model (tables \ref{priortable}, \ref{priortable2}) $M_N$ is given by
Bayes' theorem \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP}:
\begin{equation}
P(\vc{Q}|D, M_N) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_N)}{P(D|M_N)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D|M_N) = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}P(\vc{Q}|M_N)P(D|\vc{Q})\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for the main model,
\begin{equation}
P(\vc{Q}|D, M_M) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_M)}{P(D|M_M)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D|M_M) = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}P(\vc{Q}|M_M)P(D|\vc{Q})\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The posterior probabilities of the models are
\begin{equation}
\label{null-posterior}
P(M_N|D) = \frac{P(D|M_N)P(M_N)}{P(D)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{main-posterior}
P(M_M|D) = \frac{P(D|M_M)P(M_M)}{P(D)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P(D) = P(M_N)P(D|M_N)+P(M_M)P(D|M_M)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Parameter Estimation and Model Comparison}
\label{monte-carlo}

The posterior probability distributions of section
\ref{discussion-posterior} constitute a complete description of the
author's beliefs about the models and their parameters, once the data
(chapter \ref{results}) are taken into account.  However, it is a very
unwieldy description, consisting as it does of two scalar fields
defined on a $47$-dimensional space.  A summary is required for
presentation.  The author believes that the most useful summary will
be to give, for each parameter $Q_m$, estimates of its posterior
marginal expectations
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_N> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_N)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_M> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_M)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and of its posterior marginal standard deviations,
\begin{equation}
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_N) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_N>-<Q_m|D, M_N>^2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_M) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_M>-<Q_m|D, M_M>^2}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
<Q_m^2|D, M_n> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_m^2P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

The summary should also include the estimates of the model posterior
probabilities $P(M_n|D)$ (equations \ref{null-posterior},
\ref{main-posterior}.)

If a means can be found of drawing samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}$ from the distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$, where $i$ runs
from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to $J$, and the total number of
samples is, therefore, $IJ$, $<Q_m|D, M_n>$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH}
be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^JQ_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Similarly, $\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_n)$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH} be
estimated by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n)}
=\sqrt{\frac{IJ(\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
      i)}-(\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)})^2)}{IJ-1}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J((Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)})^2)}{J}\pnc{.}

$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i, j)}$ from the distribution
$P(\vc{Q}|M_n)$, where $i$ runs from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to

All of these estimators are \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} non-Bayesian,
i.e.~they coincide exactly with Bayesian posterior expectations of the
quantities being estimated, given the samples, only for specific, but
not specified, prior probability distributions over moments of the
distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$.  The estimators will, therefore,
differ by an amount $\delta$ from the posterior expectations that
would be obtained with explicit statements of plausible prior
probability distributions over these moments, if this were technically
feasible.  Fortunately, however, the size of $\delta$ tends
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} to decrease with decreasing marginal
likelihood, i.e.~with increasing number of samples.  Equally
fortunately, when the inference process aims to estimate moments of a
probability distribution, from samples from that distribution, a
critical $\delta$ for each moment is made available, by the degree of
variation implied by the higher moments, such that significantly
smaller values of $\delta$ can be safely ignored.  All this means
that, for large numbers of samples, the non-Bayesian estimators are
acceptable.

The means of obtaining samples is the leapfrog method.  This is
explained in detail in \emph{Information Theory, Inference and
  Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, where it is attributed
to Skilling.  Each iteration of the method consists of the application
of a leapfrog proposal density, followed by the application of a
Metropolis decision algorithm.  For sampling from the posterior
probability distribution, after the $i$th iteration, the method's
state is a set of $J$ parameter vectors $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  j)}$, which are the samples to be used in the estimators.  The
leapfrog proposal density sets
\begin{equation}
\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)} = 2\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  k)}-\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where, for each $j$, a $k$ is chosen at random from the other $J-1$
integers from $1$ to $J$, with each of these being equi-probable.  The
Metropolis decision algorithm then works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}if $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
    M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)} \geq{} 1$, then
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set to
    $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$.  Otherwise,
  \item{}$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set at random, either
    to $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$, or to
    $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $1-\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$.
\end{itemize}
An analogous process is used to draw samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri},
  n, i, j)}$ from the prior probability distribution.

As part of the preparation of the present thesis, the author has
written Perl code that implements the leapfrog method; in the
transparent copy of this thesis, the code for the null model $M_N$ is
in the file \patio{null}, and the code for the main model $M_M$ is in
the file \patio{main}.  As far as the author has been able to
discover, the present thesis is the first use of the leapfrog method
to infer parameters and model likelihoods from real experimental data.
Some further details are needed to define the particular version of
the leapfrog method used in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Initial vector sets $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)}$ and
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ are chosen, centred around the
  analytically-derived prior expectation values $<Q_m|M_n>$ of the
  parameters.  The displacements of the $J$ initial vectors from the
  prior expectation are picked randomly from a perfect top-hat
  distribution out to a maximum size of each displacement component,
  which is the product of a constant factor $\alpha_{pri}$ or
  $\alpha_{pos}$, and the prior standard deviation $\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n)$
  of the relevant parameter.  That is to say, $Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n,
    0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{,}
\]
and $Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{.}
\]
It has \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} been shown that the leapfrog method
rapidly grows an initial vector set that is narrower than the
distribution, from which one wishes to sample.  However, the author
does not know of any analogous proof that the algorithm can shrink an
initial vector set that is broader than the distribution, from which
one wishes to sample.  Therefore, the initial vector set, for sampling
from the prior probability distribution is made a factor of
$\exp{}(1)$, in each dimension, narrower than the prior probability
distribution.  An attempt is made to achieve the same for the
posterior probability distribution, using a guess at the width of the
posterior probability distribution.  This gives $\alpha_{pri} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\exp{}(1)}$, and $\alpha_{pos} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{(|D|-A)\exp{}(1)}$, where $|D| = 1018$ is the number
of data points, and the number of adjustable parameters is $A = 39$
for the null model $M_N$, and $A = 46$ for the main model $M_M$,
because a parameter whose prior probability distribution is a Dirac
delta function is not truly adjustable.  One further complication is
that it is necessary to ensure that, in each dimension, the width of
the initial vector set is comfortably greater than the quantum of
floating point numbers of the order of magnitude of $<Q_m|M_n>$.
Mantissae have 53 bits `on typical hardware' \cite{Ramirez:2002:PD}.
One bit is assumed to be taken up by the sign, and four bits are left,
to provide 16 possible starting ordinates, i.e.~if the half-width of
the top-hat distribution is less than $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$, it is
adjusted to $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$.
\item{}The author believes that the number $J$ of state vectors
  maintained simultaneously, in the Monte Carlo algorithm, must be at
  least the number $A$ of adjustable parameters.  This is because
  every state vector ever obtained will be some linear combination of
  the $J$ initial state vectors, and to obtain a representative
  sample, the $J$ initial state vectors must, therefore, span the
  parameter space.  In this thesis, therefore, $J = 2A$ is chosen,
  rather than the $J = 6$ or $J = 12$ suggested in \emph{Information
    Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}.
\item{}The author also believes that having a large value of $J$ will
  ameliorate the problem, noted by MacKay \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, of
  the state vectors in the leapfrog algorithm becoming stuck
  permanently at one vector set, after it has converged, because, as
  long as the parameter of interest varies smoothly in $\vc{Q}$ space,
  as the $Q_m$ must, if $J$, there will be a reasonable sampling of
  the distribution even if all the individual state vectors are
  stationary.  $P(D|\vc{Q}, M_n)$, however, might not vary smoothly is
  $\vc{Q}$ space.  Therefore, the estimates of $P(D|M_n)$ obtained
  herein should be treated with some scepticism.

  scatterer; the author produces a theory of this form in chapter

in one of which the ferromagnetic samples exert a (statistically
significant) Weiss field on the incident electrons, and in the other
of which, they do not.

\ref{main-experiment}, and indeed the theory of chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}.  The author has been unable to find an
application of these theories to specular reflection from a copper or
cobalt surface, which would allow direct, quantitative comparison with
the experimental results, although one might expect, in some rather
ill-defined sense, qualitative features in the specular reflections
from other materials to carry over to copper and cobalt.  This does
not, however, prevent direct comparison of Feder-type theories with
the theory of chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}, because the latter is not
designed to be chemically specific.

An important link between the band-structure theories and the theory
of chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft} is that, in explaining the basis of
the numerical band-structure calculation, Feder \cite{Feder:1985:PTE}

plane, as does the scatterer of chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}, this
symmetry can \cite{Feder:1985:PTE} be combined with time-reversal
symmetry, to show that the reflected beam polarization, for an
unpolarized incident beam, is parallel to the magnetic flux density,
when the latter is either in the scattering plane, or perpendicular to
the scattering plane.  This provides two important tests of the
plausibility of any proposed emergent-phenomena theory; the theory of
chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft} passes both tests.

All of the experiments described in this thesis took place within a
vacuum chamber (figures \ref{chamber}, \ref{chamber-photo}.)

The technological principles of the vacuum maintenance equipment are
described in detail in \emph{Ultrahigh Vacuum Practice}
\cite{Weston:1985:UVP}, with useful additional information in ``vacuum
technology'' \cite{:1999:VT}.  The central portion of the vacuum
chamber, in which the sample holder (figure \ref{holder}) is situated,
is \cite{Hope:1997:SPR} constructed from $\mu$-metal, in order to
screen out external magnetic fields, while most of the peripheral
portions are constructed from stainless steel.  During the experiment
described in part \ref{main-experiment}, the chamber, and associated
equipment, maintained the gas pressure to which the sample was
exposed, at all times other than during argon ion sputtering, below
$(22\pm{}0.29)\ut{pbar}$, with a base pressure of
$(140\pm{}2.9)\ut{fbar}$.

\section{Sample Holder}
\label{holder-section}
The copper crystal, which forms the basis of the samples, is held in
the vacuum chamber (figure \ref{chamber}) on a sample holder (figure
\ref{holder}.)

\end{figure}
This sample holder provides the facility for moving the sample, with
two rotational degrees of freedom, and three translational degrees of
freedom.  It also provides heating for the sample, by means of the
power developed when a current is passed through the finite Ohmic
resistance of the heating wires, and measurement of the temperature of
the sample, and of a point slightly removed in space from the sample,
by means of the two thermocouples.

\section{Argon Ion Sputtering Gun}
\label{igs}
d609 15
a623 15
The chamber (figure \ref{chamber}) contains an argon ion sputtering
gun, for use in cleaning the surface of the copper crystal.  The
principles of this device are shown in figure \ref{igf}.
\begin{figure}
\latex{\includegraphics{igf}}
\htmladdimg{./igf.png}
\caption{Schematic Diagram of the Argon Ion Sputtering Gun}
\label{igf}
\end{figure}
The argon ion beam has a cleaning effect on the sample surface by
removing a surface layer.  The surface layer removal proceeds
\cite{Luntz:1999:RTE} by surface atoms and molecules, which are struck
by argon ions, recoiling into the bulk of the sample.  The elastic
response of the bulk of the sample then expels the surface atoms and
molecules.
d625 6
a630 7
As well as removing surface impurities, the author expects the
sputtering process to have removed the surface layer of amorphous
copper, which is \cite{Bowden:1967:FL} likely to have formed during
the polishing of the surface that took place, when the copper crystal
was temporarily removed from the vacuum chamber, between the
experiments in appendix \ref{autumn-2001-experiments} and those in
appendix \ref{july-2002-experiments}.
d632 4

The gun was purchased commercially by the author's predecessors, and
is described in more detail in its manual \cite{:1991:OIA}.

\section{Electron-Beam Evaporators}
\label{evaporators}
d652 23
a674 13
Three electron-beam evaporators, for depositing cobalt, manganese, and
copper on the sample, are present in the vacuum chamber (figure
\ref{chamber}.) Figure \ref{mn-evap-figure} shows the manganese
evaporator.
\begin{figure}
\latex{\includegraphics{mn-evap-figure}}
\htmladdimg{./mn-evap-figure.png}
\caption{Schematic Diagram of the Manganese Evaporator}
\label{mn-evap-figure}
\end{figure}
This was chosen as the example evaporator, because the author is more
familiar with it than with the other two, having dismantled it to
replace the manganese charge and the cathode filament.
d676 7
a682 9
The heat generated by the current flowing in the cathode filament
excites electrons to leave the filament.  These are accelerated, by
the electric field, into the manganese (or cobalt or copper) charge,
where their kinetic energy is deposited as heat.  This evaporates some
of the manganese, producing a gas of manganese atoms and ions.  Those
that effuse from the exit hole are all travelling in roughly the same
direction, and therefore form an atom beam, which, if it strikes the
sample surface, deposits \cite{Wells:2001:TFM} a film of manganese on
that surface.
d684 22
a705 8
The manganese and copper evaporators were both constructed by the
author's predecessors, and are of very similar design.  The cobalt
evaporator, while working on the same principle, was purchased
commercially by the author's predecessors, and has the important
addition of a current collector, near its exit hole, which measures
the flux of ions, and therefore of atoms, leaving the exit hole.  This
is taken to be a measurement of the rate of cobalt deposition on the
sample.

The cobalt evaporator is described in more detail in its manual
\cite{:1992:IMU}.

\chapter[Polarimeter]{The Compact Retarding-Potential Mott
  Polarimeter}
\label{compact}
d747 15
a761 11
A Mott polarimeter has been available at the Cavendish Laboratory for
some time.  The main purpose of the polarimetry project to date has
been to increase its reliability as a measuring device to the point
where it can be used to determine the polarization of a reflected,
diffracted or secondary electron beam from an ultra-thin magnetic film
structure.  The latter has now been achieved using a specularly
reflected electron beam from a film structure which previous research
has suggested is of interest (chapter \ref{motive}.)  This has
required the finding of technical solutions to a variety of
instrumental difficulties \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} (part
\ref{intermediate-experiments}.)
d763 4
a766 28
The polarimeter now in use at the Cavendish Laboratory is of the
compact, retarding-potential type (figure \ref{sd})
\cite{Zhang:1991:LEE, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  The detector position is
chosen because there is a broad maximum in $S$ (equation \ref{xsec})
for metal foils at a scattering angle of around $120^{\circ}$
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Electrons are focused onto the thorium
target by the electrostatic grids and lenses at the front of the
device (figure \ref{sd},) and are accelerated to energies between
$20\ut{keV}$ and $25\ut{keV}$, suitable for the required low impact
parameter scattering (section \ref{so}), by an electrostatic potential
applied at the thorium foil \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  An electrostatic
potential applied at the retarding grids (figure \ref{sd}) turns back
electrons which have lost more than some specified amount of energy,
chosen by setting the retarding grid potential, during the scattering
process \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This eliminates a large proportion
of multiply scattered electrons, for which the analysing power $S$
(equations \ref{r1}, \ref{r2}) is reduced, without the reduction in
the total cross-section $\sigma _0$ (equation \ref{xsec}) which is
brought about by using a thin film target to reduce multiple
scattering \cite{Dunning:1987:UTG}.
\begin{figure}

\htmladdimg{./polarimeter.png}
\caption{The Compact Retarding Potential Mott Polarimeter.}
\label{sd}
\end{figure}
d768 85
a852 16
The use of a retarding potential also means that the external
electrodes can all be kept grounded, with the obviation of the need
for bulky shielding on the detector as well as the direct safety
benefits \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This, coupled with the relatively
small target potential of $\sim{}22\ut{kV}$, which restricts the
inter-electrode distances needed to avoid electrical breakdown, keeps
the instrument small (the distance between the two channeltrons is
$\sim{}10\ut{cm}$) \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}, which is convenient for
its attachment to a vacuum chamber (chapter \ref{chamber-chapter}) for
experiments and for development and maintenance.  In addition, the
closeness of the channeltrons to the target, and the large solid angle
which they therefore subtend, allows for a high total scattering
cross-section $\sigma_0$ (equation \ref{xsec})
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  The relatively low energy of electrons
incident on the thorium foil (figure \ref{sd}) also increases $\sigma
_0$.
d854 10
a863 13
The nature of the channeltron is presented in figure \ref{channeltron}.

\end{figure}
The functioning of the device in electron-counting mode is described
in detail in its manual \cite{::CEM}.  It can also be operated in a
continuous current measurement mode, with a small, positive collector
voltage and a sensitive ammeter connected to its front end.
d865 14
a878 13
An electron source is also needed for the experiments; for this, a
commercial electron gun is used.  The experiments in part
\ref{main-experiment} and appendix \ref{july-2002-experiments} used a
temporary replacement electron gun, since the gun that had been used
for the experiments in appendix \ref{autumn-2001-experiments} had
malfunctioned.  An unfortunate consequence of a slight geometrical
incompatibility, between the temporary replacement electron gun and
the vacuum chamber (chapter \ref{chamber-chapter},) was that
low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy
measurements were not possible, while the temporary gun was in place;
it was therefore necessary to rely on previous calibrations
(appendices \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}, \ref{auger-maths},) for the
kind of information that these techniques would have produced.
d880 41
a920 3
Both the temporary replacement electron gun, and the gun procured by
the author's predecessors, are described in detail in their respective
manuals \cite{:1997:UME, :1978:LAE}.

\chapter{The Technique of Mott Polarimetry}
\label{technique}
d936 12
a947 26
Mott polarimetry is a means of measuring the spin polarization of an
electron beam, and finds its most frequent application in
photo-emission spectroscopy \cite{Heinzmann:1990:} and the study of
surfaces, thin films and multi-layers \cite{Mulhollan:1992:LDS}.  The
latter is the application with which this thesis is primarily
concerned.  Mott polarimeters are based on the left-right asymmetry in
the scattering of polarized electrons by atoms, i.e. the relative
difference in scattering cross-section between scattering events
through the same angle in opposite senses (equation \ref{xsec},) and
its use as an indicator of the incident beam's spin polarization
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Common choices of scatterer for Mott
polarimeters are gold, thorium and uranium foils \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP}.  All of these have high proton numbers $Z$,
leading to a large spin-dependent potential correction (equation
\ref{spinorb}.)  Thorium and uranium provide a value of total
scattering cross-section $\sigma _0$ (equation \ref{xsec}) which is
around $15\%{}$ greater than that for gold \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP} and an analysing power $S$ (equation \ref{xsec})
which is improved by between $10\%{}$ and $20\%{}$
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP} or even as much as $30\%{}$
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP}.  On the other hand, thorium and uranium have the
disadvantage that their chemical reactivity renders them more
sensitive than gold to atmospheric contaminants, which may reduce both
overall cross-section and Sherman function (section \ref{crosssec})
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  For the polarimeter used in
this project, a thorium foil has been chosen (figure \ref{sd}.)

\section{The Spin-Dependence of the Scattering Potential}
\label{so}
d953 12
a964 18
The differential  cross-section as a  function of scattering  angle in
Mott scattering, i.e.  the scattering of electrons by  nuclei at small
impact  parameters,  exhibits  a   dependence  on  the  electron  spin
direction    \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,   Dunning:1994:MEP}.     As   Kessler
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE,  Kessler:1985:PE} points  out,  in addition  to
simplifying  the  potential  calculation,  the  use  of  small  impact
parameters, i.e. high energies  and large scattering angles, increases
the  analysing  power   of  the  polarimeter,  as  a   result  of  the
$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}$  dependence  of  the spin-orbit  correction
(equation \ref{spinorb}.)   The mechanism  for this can  be understood
classically,  as  the additional  term  in  the scattering  potential,
resulting  from the  torque exerted  on the  electron's  spin magnetic
moment, by the magnetic field due to the presence of a moving, charged
nucleus   in    the   electron's   rest    frame   \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
  Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Gay  \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP}  and Dunning
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP} have developed  a quantitative version of this
model for a single scattering nucleus, which results in the expression
for the spin-dependent potential contribution
d966 2
a967 3
\label{spinorb}
V_{so}'=\frac{Ze\mu _B\mathbf{L}.\mathbf{S}}{8\pi\epsilon _0\hbar
m_ec^2|\mathbf{r}|^3}\pnc{,}
a968 9
where $Z$ is the proton number of the nucleus, $\mu _B$ is the Bohr
magneton, $\mathbf{L}$ is the orbital and $\mathbf{S}$ the spin
angular momentum of the electron, in the rest frame of the nucleus,
and $\mathbf{r}$ is the displacement of the electron from the nucleus.
This potential form is equivalent to the fine splitting by the
spin-orbit interaction familiar from the analysis of bound electronic
states in atomic physics \cite{Gasiorowicz:1996:QP}.  Kessler
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} also makes some helpful
comments on this model.

\section[Cross-Section]{Spin-Dependence of the Scattering Cross-Section}
\label{crosssec}

By subjecting the general solution of the Dirac equation for a central
potential to the condition that the electron wave-function is a
superposition of a plane incident wave with a spherical (in wavefront
geometry, not necessarily in the symmetry of the scattered amplitude)
scattered wave, Kessler \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} finds it
possible to express the effect of a spin-dependent potential
correction on the scattering cross-section $\sigma $ (whether
differential or integrated over a particular solid angle) as
d975 1
a975 2
\label{xsec}
\sigma =\sigma _0(1+SP)\pnc{,}
d977 1
a977 7
where $\sigma _0$ and $S$ are functions of the incident electron
energy $E_b$, and of the scattering angle $\theta $, and $P$ is the
component of the spin polarization of the incident beam along the
normal to the scattering plane; that is to say, if the electrons were
forced to collapse into states of well-defined spin component along
this direction, the fractions with spin up $f_u$ and spin down $f_d$
would be such that

$S$ is known as the asymmetry function \cite{Sherman:1956:CSR,

  Dunning:1994:MEP} or the analysing power \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP,
  Bertacco:1999:NES}.  The only assumption about the form of the
potential that was required to obtain this result was its separability
in spherical polar co-ordinates.  All the finer details of the
potential, be it that of a single atom (section \ref{so}) or that of a
metal foil of the kind found in a real polarimeter (figure \ref{sd},)
are contained in the functional forms of $\sigma _0$ and $S$.  In
particular, if there were no mechanism, of the kind described in
equation \ref{spinorb}, for spin-dependence in the scattering
potential, then $S$ would vanish.

Equation \ref{xsec} leads directly to the left-right asymmetry in
scattering of a polarized electron beam.  Two detectors are so placed
as to collect scattered electron beams with scattering angles of the
same magnitude, but in opposite senses (figure \ref{sd}.)  The
scattering plane normals for the two detectors are therefore in
opposite directions, i.e. the polarization component $P$ is of the
same magnitude but opposite sign at the two detectors.  For a
scatterer of even quite low symmetry, $S$ will be the same for both
detectors, with the result that the rates of electron arrival at the
two detectors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, will be \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,

\section{Systematic Errors Specific to Mott Polarimetry}
\label{specific}
d1233 2
a1234 18
Gay and Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP} identify two sources of systematic
error unique to Mott polarimeters:
\begin{itemize}
\item The incoming electron beam may be misaligned (figure
\ref{misalign}.)
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\end{makeimage}
\latex{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{misalign}}
\htmladdimg{./misalign.png}
\caption{A Misaligned Incident Electron Beam.  Based on a diagram by
Gay \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP}}
\label{misalign}
\end{figure}
\item The two detectors may have efficiencies $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$,
which are less than unity.  More crucially for asymmetry measurements
(equation \ref{asymmean},) it may be that $\eta_1\neq\eta_2$.
\end{itemize}
d1236 19
a1254 31
Gay \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP} show that each of these effects
introduces a multiplicative relative systematic error in the electron
arrival rate at one channeltron compared with that at the other, which
invalidates the use of the raw asymmetry as a polarization indicator
(equation \ref{asymmean}.)  A technique has been developed
\cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP} which allows the elimination of
a systematic error of this nature.  In this scenario, the rates of
electron arrival $R_{ij}$ on channeltrons $i=1$ and $i=2$ for beams of
polarizations of equal magnitude $|P|$, in opposite directions
$j=\uparrow{}$ and $j=\downarrow{}$.  The polarization is then
given\footnote{In real experiments, the values of $R_{1\uparrow}$,
  $R_{1\downarrow}$, $R_{2\uparrow}$, and $R_{2\downarrow}$ are not
  perfectly specified, but are subject to significant random errors.
  In this case, the polarization obtained from equation \ref{rev}
  becomes an estimator; a given measurement will provide a
  polarization value, via the formula, which will not always be equal
  to the true value of the polarization, but whose value will be drawn
  from some probability distribution
  $P(P_{\textrm{formula}}|P_{\textrm{true}})$ about the true value.
  Frequentist statisticians might wish to ask whether it is an
  unbiased estimator, i.e.~whether the expectation of this probability
  distribution is equal to $P_{\textrm{true}}$.  An answer could be
  particularly difficult to derive, given the non-linearity of
  $P_{\textrm{formula}}$ in the directly measured electron arrival
  rates.  Bayesian statisticians might prefer to abandon the
  estimator, and think in terms of the simpler forward probability
  distribution
  $P(R_{1\uparrow},R_{1\downarrow},R_{2\uparrow},R_{2\downarrow}|R_0,P_{\textrm{true}})$,
  using Bayes' theorem to invert it to
  $P(R_0,P_{\textrm{true}}|R_{1\uparrow},R_{1\downarrow},R_{2\uparrow},R_{2\downarrow})$}

\section{Additive Offsets}
\label{add}
d1273 36
a1308 12
Not all systematic errors, however, are multiplicative.  Another
foreseeable class of error is the possibility of additive constants in
the electron arrival rate measurements, whether of not these additive
constants.  During the experiments presented in this thesis, the
apparent electron arrival rates (parts \ref{main-experiment},
\ref{intermediate-experiments}) at the detectors, with the electron
gun switched off, and the conditions otherwise the same as in the real
experiments, were occasionally checked.  These rates should indicate
the size of any additive systematic error.  They were found to be of
the order of $1\ut{Hz}$, which is much smaller than the measured rates
with the electron gun on.  Additive systematic errors are, therefore,
not believed to be significant here.

\label{main-experiment}
\chapter{Motivation}
\label{motive}
d1355 31
a1385 7
Colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory had earlier performed a series
of measurements on the system formed by growing a $0.5\ut{ML}$
$Mn/6\ut{ML}$ $Co/Cu(001)$ multi-layer \cite{Choi:1998:FTD,
  Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  Low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) revealed, through the existence of $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$
order spots, a $c(2\times{}2)$ (chessboard-like) superstructure in the
plane of the film.
d1387 16
a1402 37
Three possible explanations were advanced for the $c(2\times{}2)$
superstructure \cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inter-diffusion of copper atoms through the cobalt layer may
  have led to the formation of a $MnCu$ surface alloy
  \cite{Wuttig:1993:MDB, Kraan:1995:GSS}.  However, these experiments
  were performed at room temperature, which is too cold to permit
  significant inter-diffusion through $6ML$ $Co$ \cite{Kief:1993:GST}.
  This suggestion was therefore ruled out.
\item The manganese may have had an internal $c(2\times{}2)$
  anti-ferromagnetic configuration.  However, the measured
  $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ spot intensity was $\sim 10$ times that
  predicted for magnetic diffraction of this type by Tamura et
  al.~\cite{Tamura:1988:DSA}.  This phenomenon is therefore incapable
  of providing a complete explanation of the observed superstructure.
\item An ordered $MnCo$ surface alloy may have been formed.  Given the
  evidence against the other two models, the observed diffraction
  pattern was attributed to $MnCo$ alloy formation.
\end{itemize}

Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements were taken by
colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory as part of the same project
\cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  The $[110]$
direction, easy axis Kerr signal was seen to increase with the
addition of manganese, in the regime where the alloy exists.  The
immediate reaction to this is that the system's magnetic moment is
increasing, i.e. that the manganese atoms that are being added are
ferro-magnetically aligned, both with each other and with the cobalt.
However, the simultaneous drop in $[100]$ Kerr signal did not paint
the same picture, and it may be that a change in magneto-optical
response, rather than a genuine addition of magnetic moments, is
responsible for the increased $[110]$ signal.  The possibilities are
in particular need of investigation, given that a series
\cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
  M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS} of numerical calculations, using different
approximations, have produced widely differing predictions about the
magnetic properties of this system.
d1404 1
a1404 15
The polarization of a reflected electron beam from the sample surface
provides an alternative to MOKE for measuring the magnetization
through the difference, for the two electron spins, in density of
states at a particular energy created by the exchange splitting, and
as such provides an experiment which is interesting by virtue of
having an unpredictable result.  The experiments presented in this
thesis, using a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, are intended as an
intermediate stage on the way to similar measurements on
$MnCo/Co/Cu(001)$, although they could equally well lead to similar
measurements on other multi-layer structures of more direct industrial
relevance, such as metal/ferromagnet or semiconductor/ferromagnet spin
valves.  This possibility may help to address the conclusions,
concerning the motivation for experimental research projects, of the
statistical research in appendices \ref{values}, \ref{greedy}, and
\ref{natural}.
d1406 13
a1418 7
In addition, the measurements for $Co/Cu(001)$, in themselves, allow a
trial run of estimating the parameters in the theory of chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}, and comparing a version of that theory, in
which no Weiss field affects the probing electrons, against another
version, in which an adjustable Weiss field affects the probing
electrons.  This task is undertaken in appendix
\ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.

  Experimental Data on the Spin Polarization of Reflected Electron
  Beams}
\label{experimental-context}
d1434 3
a1436 15
Although the author is familiar with several examples
\cite{Dunning:1985:ESP, Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP,
  Kirschner:1985:IES, Landolt:1985:SPS, Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG,
  Lind:1987:SSA, Weber:1999:EAF} of published data, obtained using
Mott polarimeters, on the spin polarization of reflected, diffracted,
transmitted, inelastic, and secondary electron beams, from magnetic
and non-magnetic materials, rather few of them \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP,
  Gradmann:1985:ESP, Kirschner:1985:SDP} concern specular reflection.
Unfortunately, these do not include any of the publications, in which
copper \cite{Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSG, Lind:1987:SSA} or cobalt
\cite{Weber:1999:EAF} samples are used.  Nevertheless, other workers'
specular reflection experiments on metallic surfaces can be compared,
at least qualitatively, with the theory of chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}, and with the theories reviewed in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}.
d1438 4
a1441 24
Measurements of reflected beam polarization from a tungsten $(001)$
surface, as a function of incident electron energy and angle of
incidence, have been reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP}.  No error
estimates are given\footnote{However, some idea can be obtained from
  the level of reproducibility between different laboratories.},
rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of theories
quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, it is easy to imagine
that the random errors are large enough that, except in some narrow
($\sim{}20\ut{eV}$,) resonance-like energy bands, the measurements are
consistent with the energy-independent, angle-independent, zero
polarization predicted in chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}.  One of the
narrow energy bands includes $82\ut{eV}$, allowing the measurements to
be simultaneously consistent with the band-structure calculation for
tungsten, mentioned in chapter \ref{theoretical-context}.  It could be
conjectured that the narrow energy bands correspond to changes in
wave-vector on reflection, which, in some sense, match the repeat
distance of those parts of the atomic cores, which are of sufficiently
deep potential to render the electrons' kinetic energy comparable with
their rest mass energy, allowing spin-orbit polarizing effects to
become significant, and removing these narrow energy bands from the
domain of validity of the theory in chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}.
Some of the band-structure calculations, reviewed in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, appear to have captured phenomena of this
type.
d1443 2
a1444 8
Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a $Cu_3Au$ $(001)$ surface, as a function of
incident beam energy, at an angle of incidence of $13\ut{^{\circ}}$.
In the energy region above $\sim{}60\ut{eV}$, where the Taylor
expansion allows the theory of chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft} to make
quantitative predictions, the measurements appear to tend rapidly with
increasing incident energy, to the constant, zero polarization of this
theory.
d1446 5
a1450 35
The same paper \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} goes on to review measurements
of reflected beam polarization from a nickel $(001)$ surface, as a
function of incident beam energy and angle of incidence, as does
another paper \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP} in the same collection.  For
the former data set, in the energy region above $\sim{}60\ut{eV}$,
where the Taylor expansion allows the theory of chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft} to make quantitative predictions, the
measurements provide a very good match to the constant polarization
this theory.  However, they provide an approximately equally good
match to the relevant band-structure calculation, reviewed in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}.  For reasons explained in appendix
\ref{complexity}, the author is inclined to assign a higher prior
probability to the theory of chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft} than to the
band-structure theory, leading to the former being preferred in this
case of roughly equal goodness of fit.  However, prior probabilities
are (appendix \ref{prior}) subjective, and readers are, therefore,
fully entitled to disagree.  The latter data set, which uses an
estimator of the polarization designed to reveal only exchange
effects, not spin-orbit effects, is a rather better match to the
constant polarization, predicted by the theory of chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}, than to any of several band-structure theories,
reviewed in chapter \ref{theoretical-context}.

Measurements of reflected beam polarization from an iron $(110)$
surface, as a function of incident electron energy and angle of
incidence, have been reviewed \cite{Gradmann:1985:ESP}.  No error
estimates are given\footnote{However, some idea can be obtained from
  the level of reproducibility between different laboratories.},
rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of theories
quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, it is easy to imagine
that the random errors are large enough that the measurements are
consistent with the energy-independent, angle-independent, possibly
non-zero polarization predicted in chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}.
However, the relevant band-structure theories, reviewed in chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}, provide approximately an equally good fit.

the orientation of the scattering plane, relative to the crystal axes,
at an incident electron energy of $60\ut{eV}$, and an angle of
incidence of $43.5\ut{^{\circ}}$.  Again, no error estimates are
given, rendering it impossible to judge the relative merits of
theories quantitatively, by these measurements.  However, visually,
the results appear to provide a superb match to the predictions of a
band-structure calculation for this material (chapter
\ref{theoretical-context}) \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP}, and a very dubious
match to the zero polarization predicted by the theory of chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}.  Because the measurements were all taken at the
same beam energy, the conjecture above, regarding narrow energy bands
that are outside the domain of validity of the theory in chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}, might apply.

Also reviewed \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP} are measurements of reflected
beam polarization from a gold $(110)$ surface, as a function of angle
of incidence and temperature, at an incident electron energy of
$50\ut{eV}$.  Once again, no error estimates are given, rendering it
impossible to judge the relative merits of theories quantitatively, by
these measurements.  However, it does appear that there are
substantial polarizations (up to $0.6$,) which vary with angle of
incidence.  At energies as low as $50\ut{eV}$, the lowest-order Taylor
expansion in the inverse energy, which is used in chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}, is becoming dubious, and it is therefore not
clear what this theory predicts, but if the Taylor expansion were
valid, it would predict zero polarizations for all angles of
incidence.  Because the measurements were all taken at the same beam
energy, the conjecture above, regarding narrow energy bands that are
outside the domain of validity of the theory in chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}, might apply.

\section[Repeated Adaptation List]{List of Adaptations to the
  Polarimeter, and to the Measurement Technique, from \emph{Mott
    Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory} \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}}
\label{repeated-adaptation-list}
d1520 183
a1702 85
Mott polarimetry involves substantial technical difficulties.  There
follows a list of difficulties that were encountered with the
Cavendish polarimeter, and measures that were taken to overcome them,
in order to allow the experiments described in this thesis to proceed.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Significant cross-talk was discovered between the signal output
  cables on the two channeltrons; this was largely eliminated by the
  installation of improved shielding within the polarimeter.
\item{}The high voltage supply used to accelerate the electrons toward
  the thorium target was found to be unreliable; there was a
  considerable delay in the diagnosis of this fault due to the
  difficulty of finding a reasonably safe means of measuring the
  required potential difference of many $\ut{kV}$.  Once the supply
  had been discovered to be producing only $750\ut{V}$, replacement of
  the offending control potentiometer was rapidly effected.
\item{}The channeltrons are \cite{::CEM} designed as single-electron
  counting devices, intended to function by using an electrostatic
  field to accelerate an incoming electron into a collision, which
  liberates further electrons from the channeltron walls, which are in
  turn accelerated to produce further collisions.  This process
  amplifies a single electron into a current pulse containing
  $\sim{}10^8$ electrons, which is readily detectable using a digital
  counter.  However, the count rates measured by this method were
  found to be anomalously low.  This is believed to be because the
  rate, at which electrons were arriving at the channeltrons, was
  substantially above the saturation rate ($\sim{}10^4\ut{Hz}$,) at
  which the channeltrons' detection efficiency begins to drop rapidly
  with increasing electron arrival rate.  This was the case with
  specularly reflected beams of energies between $\sim{}2\ut{keV}$ and
  $\sim{} 3\ut{keV}$ from magnetic and non-magnetic surfaces, even for
  the smallest incident beam currents available.  Therefore, it was
  necessary to make adaptations to allow the use of the front ends of
  the channeltrons as Faraday cups, the current collected at which
  could be measured as a continuous flow, rather than as discrete
  electron arrival events.  To this end, an ammeter of sufficient
  sensitivity to measure the currents involved (of order $1pA$) was
  procured, and a wire which connected the front ends of the two
  channeltrons, possibly allowing flow of current between them, was
  removed.
\item With the high voltage supply to the thorium foil in operation,
  continuous current measurement revealed current spikes, occurring at
  a frequency of $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$, peaking at what later transpired to
  be approximately the steady current, which was obtained in
  successful measurements.  The spikes were set against a background
  of substantially lower current, and were also detected as pulses in
  single electron counting mode, whether or not an accelerating
  potential difference was applied across the channeltrons.  This is
  now believed to have been a consequence of the electrical connection
  to the thorium foil and surrounding assembly from outside the vacuum
  chamber having some freedom of movement inside its insulating
  casing, leading to a situation in which there was good electrical
  contact only for brief periods, occurring at $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$,
  producing the spikes that represented the current in the intended
  operating condition.  The effect has disappeared since the
  mechanical security of the connection was improved.
\item Calculation of raw asymmetries
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},+} = \frac{f_{+,1}-f_{+,2}}{f_{+,1}+f_{+,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},-} = \frac{f_{-,1}-f_{-,2}}{f_{-,1}+f_{-,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
from the measurements \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} on the reflected beam
from $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ shows larger uncertainties, and slightly
poorer consistency between the two runs of the experiment than the
results from the use of the formula (equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}) for the elimination of
multiplicative systematic errors, suggesting that the multiplicative
errors do exist, and were subject to drift over the period between the
two runs of the experiment, and that the use of the formula, with the
polarization reversal achieved using opposite remanent magnetization
directions of the film structure, was a necessary measure.
\item The difficulty of adjusting the zero on the ammeter used for
  continuous current measurements, given its slow response both to the
  zeroing control and to changes in the current which it was
  measuring, led to a suspicion that there might be additive offsets
  which would require a fitting procedure of the kind introduced in
  \emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
  \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  The non-zero and variable values obtained
  for the channeltron currents at zero incident beam current, using
  this procedure, indicate that such offsets do exist, and are subject
  to drift; therefore, both the fitting procedure and the time
  ordering of the experiments were necessary precautions.

because, from the theory in chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}, and indeed
from any theory, in which the process of changing the magnetization

the reflected electron beam's spin polarization, one would expect the
changes in the two channeltrons' arrival rates, on reversing the
magnetization direction, to be opposite.  This has (table
\ref{movement-directions}) been the case in only one of the

The width of the electron beam is of the order of $1\ut{mm}$, and the
width of the polarimeter opening is of order $2\ut{mm}$.  Therefore,
any displacement of $\sim{}100\ut{\mu{}m}$ or more will have a
significant effect on the acceptance probability.  It is clear, from
the graph, that a displacement of this size can be obtained with a

\section[Traditional Estimation]{Traditional Estimation of the Mott
  Asymmetries}
\label{traditional-estimation-section}
d3403 12
a3414 60
Other workers \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP} have considered,
in a non-Bayesian framework, the possibility of the two electron
detectors in a Mott polarimeter having different detection
efficiencies $\eta_i$, either due to intrinsic properties of the
detectors, or due to a misalignment of the heavy-metal foil that
perturbed the scattering probabilities at the two detectors, and
devised the following estimator of the product $SP$ of Sherman
function and beam polarization, in the presence of such a
multiplicative systematic error:
\begin{equation}
\label{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}
SP = \frac{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}-\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}+\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This estimator relies on the the electron arrival rates $f_{i,j}$, at
detectors $j = 1$ and $j = 2$, being measured for beams which, on
entering the polarimeter, are of the same intensity, and of
polarizations that have equal magnitudes, and opposite signs $i =
\pm$.  These conditions are met, in the experiments currently being
reported, as long as the only effect, on the reflected electron beam,
of reversing the sample magnetization is to reverse the beam
polarization.  In particular, this requires that the spin-orbit
interaction at the sample is negligible, as indeed it is, since the
kinetic energies of the electrons are much less than their rest mass
energy.

In this section, the results will be interpreted using equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, as an alternative to the
Bayesian inference process described in appendix
\ref{adaptive-models}.  Note that the estimator could be re-derived,
as the expectation value of $SP$ in a Bayesian model with appropriate
assumptions.  This would have the advantage of allowing these
assumptions, which would be made explicit by the Bayesian approach, to
be examined for plausibility, and changed if necessary (see also
appendix \ref{prior}.)  Unfortunately, the model would be a model
\emph{of} the reflected beam, not of the sample, and therefore
successful estimation of its parameters does not further the aim of
determining characteristics of the sample.

The procedure used here will be to divide the data set into subsets;
the members of any given subset will be all the measurements of
electron arrival rate taken under one particular set of conditions of
film thickness, incident beam energy, incident beam current, and data
acquisition apparatus dwell time.  By the design of the experiments,
each of these subsets will contain four measurements, of the correct
mutual relationship to be used as the $f_{i,j}$ in equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}.  This will provide three or
four asymmetry values for each combination of film thickness and beam
energy; the arithmetic mean of these is taken for presentation.  The
results of this procedure are shown in figures
\ref{20020919_Polarimetry_1_asyms},
\ref{20020920_Polarimetry_1_asyms},

\ref{20020923_Polarimetry_2_asyms}.

From a visual inspection of published calibration data (figure
\ref{HER_Sherman},) the Sherman function is $S \approx{} -0.23$.

This estimator is clearly indicating non-zero asymmetries in most
cases, indicating that, despite the above-described systematic error
due to the stray field from the sample or its holder (section
\ref{visual},) the experiments have successfully detected the cobalt's
Weiss field.  This is comforting, given that a Bayesian statistical
analysis (appendix \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff},) which the author
believes to be more rigorous than the use of the estimator in equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, indicates (appendix
\ref{further-conclusions}) very decisively that the experiments have
detected the cobalt ferro-magnetism.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{experiment-conclusions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The traditional estimator of the Mott asymmetry, and therefore
  of the reflected electron beam's spin polarization, provides
  well-defined, mostly non-zero values, indicating that, despite the
  systematic error in the electron arrival rates, described below, the
  experiments have successfully detected the cobalt's Weiss field.
\item{}The spin polarization produced by the cobalt's Weiss field is
  of a similar order of magnitude ($\sim{}10\%$) to that found by
  other workers in various independent laboratories, using polarized
  electron reflection from other ferro-magnetic transition metals
  (section \ref{experimental-context}.)
\item{}There is some strong evidence that the stray magnetic field of
  the sample (or of some part of the sample holder) is significantly
  affecting the electron trajectories, creating a
  magnetization-dependent systematic error in the measured electron
  arrival rates at the Mott polarimeter's detectors.
d3637 12
a3648 15
The genuine effect of the cobalt's Weiss field can be detected, even
in the presence of the systematic error due to stray magnetic fields,
because the two have significantly different signatures in the
electron arrival rates at the channeltrons.  When the sample
magnetization is reversed, the characteristic behaviour caused by the
stray-field systematic error is for the electron arrival rates, at the
two channeltrons, to change by the same factor, in the same sense,
i.e.~either both increase, or both decrease.  The characteristic
behaviour caused by a genuine spin polarization, produced by the
cobalt's Weiss field, on the other hand, is for the electron arrival
rates, at the two channeltrons, to change by the same factor, in
opposite senses, i.e.~one increases and the other decreases.  It was
also this dissimilarity in signatures that allowed the systematic
error to be noticed in the first place (table
\ref{movement-directions}.)
d3650 142
a3791 27
In physical terms, the various methods used to analyse the data,
namely the least-squares curve fitting of chapter \ref{results}, the
asymmetry estimation of section \ref{traditional-estimation-section},
and the Bayesian inference of appendix \ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}
are all seeking the same effect, notwithstanding their substantial
differences of statistical approach.  All of them are testing for the
electron arrival rates changing, on sample magnetization reversal, by
the same factor in opposite senses.  All of them are, therefore,
sensitive to genuine spin polarizations, rather than to the
stray-field systematic error, and all of them declare decisively that
they have found such polarizations.

Of course, it is possible for both a genuine polarization and a stray
field to occur simultaneously, and for their effects to be
superimposed on one another.  This appears to be the case in the
experiments discussed in the present thesis.  In this case, the
systematic error in the electron arrival rates, caused by the stray
field, has the following two effects.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Quantitative estimation of the polarizations, and therefore of
  the electro-magnetic parameters of the sample, by any of the
  data processing methods, is rather imprecise, i.e.~has a large
  random error.
\item{}Visual inspection of the electron arrival rate data cannot
  easily pick out the individual effects (genuine spin polarization
  and stray field) from the superposition of the two.
\end{enumerate}
d3793 3
a3795 11
It would, therefore, be much better if a way were found to eliminate
the stray field, both to make the essential physical process of spin
polarization by the exchange interaction more obvious visually, and to
improve quantitative estimation of the Weiss field involved.  Lind
\cite{Lind:1987:SSG} found such a method for his particular
experimental configuration, which involved following the field applied
to magnetize the sample with a smaller applied field, in the opposite
direction.  It is, however, unclear how Lind determined that this
method was a success, what physical mechanism allows the technique to
work, and whether it will be applicable to experimental apparatus
other than Lind's, such as the apparatus used for the present thesis.

\chapter{Intermediate Experiment 1}
\label{autumn-2001-experiments}

A preliminary experiment, related to this thesis, was described in
\emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
\cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  That report presents Mott asymmetries of
reflected electron beams from a $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ structure, using
the estimator of equation \ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}.
Those measurements are of much lower precision than the measurements
presented in this thesis (chapter \ref{results}, section
\ref{traditional-estimation-section},) and the report remains of
interest primarily for its list of the adaptations that were made to
the polarimeter, and to the measurement technique, in order to bring
it into a sufficiently functional condition to undertake the
preliminary experiment.  That list is repeated in section
\ref{repeated-adaptation-list} of this thesis.  Similarly, this
appendix, and appendix \ref{july-2002-experiments}, are concerned with
the polarimetry measurements that were performed after the preliminary
experiment, and before the main experiment of part
\ref{main-experiment}, the technical adaptations that were discovered
to be necessary, as a result of those intermediate measurements, and
the implementation of those adaptations.
d3854 2
a3855 11
After the preliminary experiment, considerable resources were devoted
to equipment repairs, and to safety-related upgrades, which did not
constitute adaptations of the polarimeter, or of the measurement
technique.  Once this was done, concerted efforts began to produce
more decisive polarized electron reflection measurements than those in
that report, starting with pilot experiments on $Co/Cu(001)$
structures, without the added manganese; compared with most of the
preliminary measurements, lower beam energies were used in the
intermediate experiments, leading to more intense reflected beams, and
greater precision in the current (or electron arrival rate)
measurements at the channeltrons.
d3857 52
a3908 17
In the first such intermediate experiment, the method was very similar
to that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences
being that the channeltrons were used as Faraday cups, measuring
continuous currents, instead of counting individual electrons, and
that the position of the sample was only set to a precision of
$1\ut{mm}$ in translational degrees of freedom, and $1^{\circ}$ in the
rotational degree of freedom with the vertical rotation axis.  Some of
the results are displayed in table \ref{intthick1} and figures

In addition to the polarized electron reflection measurements, Auger
electron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction were used
for structural characterization of some of these samples.  They
revealed that the copper surfaces produced by a sputtering and
annealing process of similar extent to that in chapter \ref{results}
were clean and well ordered, and that a significant amount of cobalt
was being deposited.
d4310 76
a4385 32
A number of features of the data stand out.  Firstly, instead of being
downward sloping and convex $\cup$, the electron arrival rate as a
function of beam energy is upward sloping and concave $\cap$.  After
independent tests of the voltage arriving at the retarding grids
(figure \ref{sd},) this was attributed to the power supply in use for
the retarding grids having the wrong polarity to maintain a constant
energy loss window, resulting in an energy loss window that increased
at twice the rate of increase of the incident beam energy, and a
$\Gamma$ (figure \ref{HER_Average}) that increased with increasing
incident beam energy.  A new power supply, with the correct polarity,
was procured for the experiments described in appendix
\ref{july-2002-experiments} and part \ref{main-experiment}.  Secondly,
the electron arrival rate for a given set of conditions was not
reproduce-able, as is vividly displayed in the histograms of the
detector current, which are clearly multi-modal.  After independent
tests of the current arriving at a given detector, as the sample
position was varied, this was attributed to the variation in position
of the sample between different measurements, and a corresponding
variation in the fraction of the specularly reflected beam that was
accepted at the front of the polarimeter.  Fortunately, the same tests
indicated that a precision of $0.1\ut{mm}$ in the translational
degrees of freedom, and $0.1^{\circ}$ in the rotation about the
vertical axis, which was feasible with the available equipment (figure
\ref{holder},) would be adequate to render this effect negligible.
Thirdly, at the low incident beam energies, where the energy loss
window was in the region where $S$ is large enough to provide spin
sensitivity (figure \ref{HER_Sherman},) $\Gamma$ was so small as to
stretch the limits of the sensitivity of continuous current
measurements.  For subsequent experiments (appendix
\ref{july-2002-experiments}, part \ref{main-experiment},) therefore, a
move was made to single electron counting.  To succeed in this move
required the procurement and installation of new channeltrons.

In the second intermediate experiment, the method was very similar to
that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant differences being
that longer dwell times were used, and more electron counts were
recorded, resulting in an experiment that lasted around $17\ut{hours}$
for each film thickness, rather than the $2\ut{hours}$ or so of the
experiment in part \ref{main-experiment}.  Some of the results are

In many cases, the electron arrival rate appears not to be a smooth
function of the incident beam energy.  Inspection of the detailed data
sets, based on the counts in single periods of $\tau$, rather than of
$256\tau$, reveals that this is associated with a gradual variation in
time of the count rate, for fixed conditions\footnote{These detailed
  data sets are available in the transparent copy of this thesis, in
  the files whose names contain the word ``detailed.''}.  The
variations are tentatively attributed to drift in the detection
efficiencies of the channeltrons, and have an amplitude of
approximately $10\%$ of the average sensitivity peak-to-peak, on a
time-scale of the order of a few hours.  This is the reason for much
faster experiments being used in part \ref{main-experiment}.

\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction: The Bayesian View of Probability
  and Statistics}
\label{bayes-intro}

Probabilities are \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI} often used to represent the
chances of particular outcomes of a sampling of a random variable,
when the outcome is so far indeterminate.  For example, before a
standard die is thrown, the score which will be obtained might take
any of the integer values from $1$ to $6$ inclusive.  What is already
known about the score can then be represented by a probability
distribution; typically, a probability $\frac{1}{6}$ is assigned to
each of the possible outcomes.  There is \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI} a
perspective on probability and statistics, known as frequentism, in
which the description of random variables, whose outcomes are so far
indeterminate, is seen as the only appropriate use of probability.
For most of the twentieth century, frequentism was
\cite{Pollard:1986:BSE, MacKay:2001:ITI} the dominant view in the
field of probability.

However, an alternative perspective exists \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI}.  It
is common to use a probability to represent the degree to which one
believes in the truth of an assertion.  Contestants on the television
quiz \emph{Who Wants to Be a Millionaire}, who ``phone a friend'' to
ask for advice, often ask the friend to estimate a percentage
confidence which they have in their answer.  They are using
probabilities to represent degrees of belief, in the way that is meant
here.  The use of probabilities to represent degrees of belief is
\cite{Cox:1946:PFR} technically feasible, so long as the degrees of
belief satisfy three conditions, known as the Cox axioms.  The
viewpoint in which it is seen as epistemologically valid to use
probabilities to represent degrees of belief, as well as to describe
random variables, is \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI} known as Bayesianism.

There is \cite{Howson:1989:SRB, Svyantek:1992:ABM, MacKay:2001:ITI} a
mathematical principle known as Bayes' theorem, which, for two events
or propositions $E$ and $T$, relates the conditional probability
$P(E|T)$ of $E$ being true, given that $T$ is true, and the
conditional probability $P(T|E)$ of $T$ being true, given that $E$ is
true, with the marginal probabilities $P(E)$ and $P(T)$ of $E$ and
$T$, that is to say the overall probabilities which $E$ and $T$ have,
each averaged over the probability distribution of truth or falsehood
of the other proposition, as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{bayes}
P(T|E)=\frac{P(E|T)P(T)}{P(E)}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
In a frequentist perspective, Bayes' theorem is merely an interesting
generalization about the mutual correlations between random variables.
In the Bayesian world-view, on the other hand, Bayes' theorem sits at
the heart of epistemology, because it provides a rule for generating
the \emph{posterior probability} $P(T|E)$, representing the degree of
belief in a theory $T$, in the light of observational or experimental
evidence $E$, from the \emph{likelihood} $P(E|T)$, which is the
probability that $T$ assigns to the occurrence of $E$, the \emph{prior
  probability} $P(T)$, representing the degree of belief in $T$ before
the occurrence of $E$, and the \emph{marginal likelihood} $P(E)$,
which is the average $\sum_{T\in{}S}P(E|T)P(T)$, over the set $S$ of
all available theories, of the likelihood; that is to say, Bayes'
theorem is a rule for drawing an inference, from evidence $E$, about
the truth of theory $T$.

It will be useful to define some terminology here.  For the purposes
of this thesis, a \emph{postulate} is a descriptive statement about
some aspect of the behaviour of the universe, and a \emph{theory} is a
set of postulates simultaneously believed to be true.  A
\emph{hypothesis} is a prediction, derived from a theory using rules
of logic\footnote{The rules of logic are \cite{Shulman:1996:WWC}
  themselves among the postulates.}, about the consequences of some
act or omission.  A \emph{value} is a prescriptive statement about the
desirability of some process or situation, and an \emph{ideology} is a
set of values simultaneously believed to be good.  A \emph{policy} is
a decision, derived from an ideology using hypotheses, to undertake
some act or omission\footnote{The author apologizes for any confusion
  caused by the fact that the definition of ``hypothesis'' here is
  different from that used by MacKay \cite{MacKay:1992:BI,
    MacKay:1992:BMA, MacKay:2001:ITI}, or by the fact that the
  definition of ``value'' here is different from some commonplace
  definitions.}.  In Bayesian analysis, hypotheses take the form of
likelihood values.

Bayesian inference has been used to interpret empirical data in many
natural and social science research projects, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item the determination of the gravitational field strength at several
individual locations in East Africa, using the accumulated
measurements from all the locations, to obtain more precise results
than would have been available had the measurements at each location
been treated separately, given that the instruments used in all cases
were similar; a Bayesian method was also used for a similar problem in
Europe, in which it was only possible to rely on the similarity of the
measuring instruments in some cases \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP},
\item the comparison of a hypothesis, in which the probability of an
  individual, who is a member of a pair of twins, being convicted of a
  crime is independent of whether the twins are identical or
  non-identical, with another (more adjustable) hypothesis, in which
  the probability of conviction may depend on whether the twins are
  identical or non-identical \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP},
\item the comparison of a hypothesis, in which the probability of a
  word, which is in a list whose psycho-analytical gender associations
  were stated by Freud, having a particular grammatical gender is
  independent of its psycho-analytical gender, with another (more
  adjustable) hypothesis, in which the probability of the word having
  a particular grammatical gender may depend on its psycho-analytical
  gender \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP},
\item the determination of the crystallographic structure of two
  organic compounds, from X-ray diffraction measurements
  \cite{Bannister:1988:MPD}, and
\item the determination of the magnetic properties of a multi-layer
  sample, from Brillouin light scattering measurements
  \cite{McPhail:2001:BLS}.
\end{itemize}

a4979 34
As is \cite{Swepson:1998:SIR} often the case in epistemology, the
Bayesian world-view represents an ideal of knowledge-seeking which may
never be attainable in full.  However, unlike many epistemologies, the
Bayesian world-view, by virtue of being expressed in mathematical
terms, lends \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, Minka:2001:FAA} itself to
approximation methods (appendix \ref{approx}) which allow real
research activity to approach the ideal.  For example, Minka
\cite{Minka:2001:FAA} compares the performance of several approximate
Bayesian inference methods in a variety of problems, including
inferring the probability of an individual suffering from heart or
thyroid disease, given some observed data about the individual and
data about whether members of a ``training set'' of other individuals,
with given observed data, suffered from heart or thyroid disease.

The inference method described above requires a prior probability
distribution: the initial prior probability distribution represents
the degrees of belief in the theories in the absence of \emph{any}
evidence, except where the approximation in appendix \ref{imperfect} is
in use.  Subsequently, the posterior probability distribution, which
represents the degrees of belief in the various theories, after any
given observation, becomes \cite{Howson:1989:SRB} the prior
probability distribution, for inference from the next observation.
The final posterior probability distribution is, nevertheless,
independent of the order in which various pieces of evidence are
presented; repeated applications of Bayes' theorem (equation
\ref{bayes}) show:
\begin{eqnarray}
P(T|E_1,E_2) & = & \frac{P(E_2|E_1,T)P(T|E_1)}{P(E_2|E_1)}\br
& = & \frac{P(E_2|E_1,T)P(E_1|T)P(T)}{P(E_2|E_1)P(E_1)}\br
& = & \frac{P(E_1|E_2,T)P(E_2|T)P(E_1|T)P(T)}{P(E_1|T)P(E_2|E_1)P(E_1)}\br
& = & \frac{P(E_1|E_2,T)P(E_2|T)P(T)}{P(E_1|E_2)P(E_2)}\br
& = & \frac{P(E_1|E_2,T)P(T|E_2)}{P(E_1|E_2)}\br
& = & P(T|E_2,E_1)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

Inference according to Bayes' theorem unites \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP,
  Garrett:1988:PPS, Howson:1989:SRB} inductive and deductive
  reasoning, explicitly linking the inductive act of assessing several
  theories $T_i$, in the light of a particular piece of evidence $E$,
  by calculating the posterior probabilities $P(T_i|E)$, with the
  deductive act of generating the likelihoods $P(E_j|T)$ of several
  pieces of evidence $E_j$, from a particular theory $T$.

The purpose of this thesis is to arrive at some of the epistemological
insights of recent decades, many of which have originated in the
social sciences, from this Bayesian starting-point, and in particular
to emphasize similarities between Bayesian statistics and the
standpoint epistemology that has grown out of the new social movements
of feminism, anti-racism, and environmentalism, especially feminism;
to this end, \emph{The Science Question in Feminism}
\cite{Harding:1986:SQF}, and the works cited therein as having
contributed to the development of standpoint epistemology, will be
taken to be describing the standpoint epistemology, as will \emph{Is
Science Multicultural?} \cite{Harding:1998:ISM}, and ``Towards a
Methodology for Feminist Research'' \cite{Mies:1993:MFR}\footnote{In
the latter case, the author has taken a small, and, it is hoped,
justified, liberty, in identifying a work which does not mention the
word ``standpoint'' as part of the standpoint epistemology; it is the
author's assumption throughout that ``standpoint epistemology'' can be
used to describe a collection of insights, mostly from the new social
movements, much broader than that which explicitly goes under the
name.}.  Having given a mathematical foundation to these insights, it
is hoped to bring some of them to bear on current directions in the
physical sciences.  The author's aim in all of this is to encourage
more natural and social science researchers to use Bayesian statistics
and standpoint epistemology, in their selection of experiments and
interpretation of evidence.

As is clear from the above, Bayesian inference is
\cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} a quantitative method of
determining degrees of belief.  This may require some justification,
because many in the standpoint epistemology movement are
\cite{Reinharz:1979:BSS} suspicious of quantitative methods.  The
author believes that this suspicion arises from a definition of
``quantitative,'' used in the social sciences, into which Bayesian
inference does not fall, and which is significantly narrower than that
used in mathematics and in the physical sciences.  In the social
sciences, ``quantitative research'' means a method of investigating
social phenomena in which the answer to a question, whether that
question is answered by a researcher making observations, or by a
member of the community being studied, to whom the question is posed
by a researcher, is given by the selection of one or more of a
countable, finite, and usually rather small, set of pre-defined
categories.  Mathematicians and physical scientists might prefer to
term this ``discrete research.''

Standpoint epistemologists, and others in the new social movements,
criticize discrete research on several grounds.  Firstly, they argue
that the pre-definition of the categories constrains the members of
the community being studied to answers or descriptions, which may be
influenced more by the preconceptions of the researcher who devised
the categories, than by the true opinions or behaviours of the members
of that community.  Secondly, they argue
\cite{Epstein_Jayaratne:1993:VQM} that the small number of the
categories destroys any hope of obtaining a useful description of a
system as complicated as those studied in the social sciences.
Thirdly, they argue \cite{Berger:1974:USW, Mies:1993:MFR} that the
brevity of the ``category-selection'' responses, and the
interrogation-like nature of questions intended to be answered in this
way, militate against the construction of a relationship of trust and
shared aims between researcher and researched, which could motivate
the researched to take the pains necessary to answer accurately, or
indeed at all.

The author believes that the quantitative nature of the description of
degrees of belief in Bayesian inference is immune to the first two
criticisms.  For the first criticism, as long as the degrees of belief
obey the Cox axioms, no other constraint is \cite{Cox:1946:PFR} placed
on them by their description by probabilities.  For the second
criticism, the number of possible degrees of belief in Bayesian
inference, far from being small, is infinite and uncountable.  The
third criticism may require that, if one is trying to draw out the
beliefs of others, some other description of the beliefs should be
solicited either instead of, or in addition to, the Bayesian
probabilities.  Perhaps, in any such study, discussing inference
processes, rather than merely asking about the degrees of belief,
which those processes have as final results, would be useful.
However, that is not the concern of this thesis.

\chapter[Positivism]{Orthodox Science: The Principles of Positivism}
\label{positivism}
\section{Core Positivism}
\label{core}

The standpoint epistemology, and many other new epistemological
insights, have grown from critiques of positivism, and as proposed
alternatives to the positivist view, which is seen as an orthodox
epistemology in science.  Therefore, it is appropriate for any
Bayesian examination of these insights to begin by describing each of
the principles of positivism in Bayesian terms, i.e.\ {}by modelling
each mathematically, as a constraint on the probabilities involved in
positivist knowledge.  Building Bayesian mathematical models of
philosophical principles, previously expressed in natural language, is
a tradition established by Garrett \cite{Garrett:1988:PPS}.

Positivism can \cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} be defined by a set of four
characteristics, the possession of which by a theory is, for a
positivist, a measure of the validity of that theory as part of
knowledge.  An analysis of these characteristics follows.

\subsection{Phenomenalism}
\label{phenomenalism}

Positivism requires \cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} that a theory does not
  contain postulates that are incapable of being contradicted by
  experience.  If the truth or falsehood of a claim has no observable,
  or potentially observable, effects, that claim cannot form part of
  positivist knowledge.  Examples, from physics, of assertions which
  would be ruled out of positivist knowledge by this principle, would
  be claims about \cite{Rae:1992:QM, Gasiorowicz:1996:QP,
  Shan:1999:IWF} the absolute value of the phase of a quantum
  mechanical wave-function, or about \cite{Burley:1997:IPN} the
  absolute value of an electric potential.  This principle is known as
  \emph{phenomenalism}.
  
  Phenomenalism can be described simply in terms of probabilities.  It
  excludes from knowledge any theory $T$, in which the degree of
  belief in $T$ is unaffected by any conceivable evidence $E$, i.e.\ 
  {}any $T$ for which
\begin{equation}
\label{immutable}
P(T|E)=P(T)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for all conceivable pieces of evidence $E$.  Bayes' theorem (equation
\ref{bayes}) reveals that this is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
P(E|T)=P(E)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\iff{}P(E|T) = P(E|\bar{T})\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{T}$ represents the negation of $T$, i.e. $\bar{T}$ is true
if and only if $T$ is false.

There are two reasons for a theory $T$ to obey equation
\ref{immutable}, and thereby to be ruled out of positivist knowledge.
Firstly, it may be an intrinsic characteristic of $T$ that it fails to
generate any likelihoods $P(E|T)$, which differ from the likelihoods
$P(E|\bar{T})$; it may be a theory that neglects to mention any
observable consequences at all.  While the Bayesian view does not
include an explicit prohibition on such theories, it is clear that
such a theory will always have a posterior probability equal to its
prior probability, and that belief or disbelief in it will therefore
remain an arbitrary and subjective choice (appendix \ref{prior}.)
Secondly, the initial prior probability distribution may have been set
up to produce $P(T|E)=P(T)$ for all $E$, most straightforwardly by
having either $P(T)=0$ or $P(T)=1$.  This initial prior probability
distribution seems unreasonable, because it assigns the certainty of
either truth or falsehood to a theory before any evidence has been
considered.  Therefore, positivism's first rule for knowledge does not
appear to place any particularly strong restrictions on theories, as
compared with Bayesian inference. Garrett \cite{Garrett:1988:PPS}
calls phenomenalism \emph{testability}, and also notes that it is a
reasonable principle for a Bayesian to adopt.

\subsection{Occam's Razor}
\label{occam}

Positivism requires \cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} that a theory does not
contain any more postulates than are necessary to express, in compact
form, the observations that have been made\footnote{Kolakowski
  \cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} does not unambiguously identify the
  entities whose number is to be minimized as postulates.  However,
  both Jeffreys \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP} and Rae \cite{Rae:1992:QM}
  interpret the positivist Occam's razor as a principle of fewest
  postulates.}.  In positivism, theories with few postulates are
preferred to theories with many postulates.  This meant, for example,
that before observations, such as \cite{Rae:1992:QM,
  Gasiorowicz:1996:QP} that of the photo-electric effect in metals,
were made which were incompatible with Newton's laws of classical
mechanics, positivism would have favoured classical mechanics, which
has \cite{Glauert:1960:PD} two independent postulates, over quantum
mechanics, which needs \cite{Rae:1992:QM} five postulates to specify
the behaviour of mechanical systems.  This principle is known as
\emph{Occam's razor}.

A typical implementation of Occam's razor is the form of hypothesis
testing attributed to Cournot \cite{Cournot:1843:ETC}.  In this
method, at any given time, one theory $T_n$, known as the \emph{null
  hypothesis}, is accepted as correct.  If the likelihood $P(E|T_n)$
of the evidence $E$, given the null hypothesis, drops below some
small, critical value $\epsilon{}$, then the null hypothesis is
abandoned in favour of the next theory in line, $T_{n+1}$.  Occam's
razor then appears as the ordering of theories, $T_n$ being a theory
of $n$ postulates; as Anderson \cite{Anderson:1992:RTB} explained, in
his exposition of Bayesian analysis, the null hypothesis is the
simplest available theory.  This system of ordering theories is here
called the positivist Occam's razor, in order to distinguish it, as
MacKay \cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} already has, from the
form of Occam's razor which arises naturally in Bayesian statistics,
through the Occam factor.  The difference is that, while the
positivist Occam's razor uses the prior probability distribution to
punish theories for having many postulates, irrespective of their
relationship to the evidence, the Bayesian Occam factor directly takes
into account, without reference to number of postulates or
interference in the prior probability distribution, any adaptation
which has been made in a theory in response to evidence, as a
reduction in the extent to which the same evidence can be used to
argue in favour of the adapted theory.

This bears closer examination.  From a Bayesian perspective, the
boundary between believing in $T_n$ and believing in $T_{n+1}$ must
occur where
\begin{equation}
P(T_n|E)=P(T_{n+1}|E)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow{}\frac{P(E|T_n)P(T_n)}{P(E)}=\frac{P(E|T_{n+1})P(T_{n+1})}{P(E)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{recursion0}
\Rightarrow{}P(T_{n+1})=\frac{P(E|T_n)P(T_n)}{P(E|T_{n+1})}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
In Cournot's \cite{Cournot:1843:ETC} method, this boundary occurs
where $P(E|T_n)=\epsilon{}$.  It is reasonable to assume that the
specific, non-adjustable $T_{n+1}$ under consideration is that with
the highest likelihood, and further, that the evidence will not, at
the stage where some $T_n$ is still being entertained, have pulled the
likelihoods in all of the $n+1$ postulate theories away from unity,
because the disjunction of all available $n+1$ postulate theories has
a vastly greater ability to adjust to evidence than the disjunction of
all available $n$ postulate theories.  Therefore, $P(E|T_{n+1})=1$.
Equation \ref{recursion0} then becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{recursion}
P(T_{n+1})=\epsilon{}P(T_n)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{recursion} provides a recursion relation, associated
with Cournot's \cite{Cournot:1843:ETC} implementation of the
positivist Occam's razor, for the prior probability of a specific,
non-adjustable theory of $n$ postulates.  Once the number of available
theories of any given number of postulates is known, it therefore
gives the absolute value of the prior probability of a theory of $n$
postulates, as a function of $n$.  The crucial point is not the form
of this function, but the fact that positivism, implemented in this
way, can be associated with a particular prior probability
distribution at all.  The assertion of correctness for a particular
prior probability distribution places this implementation of
positivism in a tradition known as logical probability, which
conflicts (appendix \ref{prior}) with modern Bayesian statistics.

\subsection{Exclusion of Ideologies and Ideology-Theory Mixtures}

Positivism requires \cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} that a theory does not
recommend courses of action, being restricted to describing
characteristics of the universe.  The characteristics of the universe
that are described may include the consequences of particular actions,
but the desirability or otherwise of those consequences is a matter
for speculation outside of positivist knowledge.  In other words, in
terms of the definitions being used here (chapter \ref{bayes-intro},)
neither pure ideologies, which consist solely of values, nor
ideology-theory mixtures, which include both postulates and values,
may enter into positivist knowledge, which includes only pure
theories, consisting solely of postulates.  An example is
\cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} that a positivist would not accept the
statement ``penicillin should be administered in cases of pneumonia''
into scientific knowledge, requiring it to be separated into the
postulate ``penicillin is an effective cure for pneumonia,'' and the
value ``it is good to cure the sick,'' and accepting only the former
into scientific knowledge.

This third characteristic of positivist knowledge is concerned with
values, and excludes them from knowledge.  At first glance, it may
appear that Bayesian knowledge also concerns itself only with
inferences about postulates.

However, there may also be a way of applying the Bayesian inference
process to values.  In the definitions of ``ideology'' and ``theory''
used in this thesis (appendix \ref{bayes-intro},) there is, deliberately, a
striking logical similarity between the descriptive and the
prescriptive.  It is easy to imagine building theories about the
ideology to which a particular person subscribes, then attempting to
draw inferences, about the truth of those theories, from that person's
observed policies; this is the nature of Patrick and Wallace's
\cite{Patrick:1981:SCG} Bayesian analysis of theories of the design
principles behind stone circles.  Having accepted this, it is entirely
conceivable that, as Rawls \cite{Rawls:1973:TJ} has explained, one
could choose one's own ideology, by an inference process, from one's
intuitive preferences for particular policies.  Feynman
\cite{Feynman:1988:WDY} hinted at a similar analogy, when he compared
the testing and possible rejection of theories in physics with the
testing and possible rejection of political parties in democratic
government.  One could, further, use Bayes' theorem (equation
\ref{bayes}) as the inference rule, updating from the prior
probability $P(I)$ of choosing a particular ideology $I$, to the
posterior probability $P(I|y)$, given that one intuitively prefers
policy $y$, using the likelihood $P(y|I)$ and the marginal likelihood
$P(y)$.  A Bayesian who is interested in prescriptive ideologies as
well as descriptive theories can, therefore, develop knowledge about
both by the same methods.  However, this will not be the thrust of
this thesis; where a choice of policy becomes relevant, it will be
considered to be made by someone who believes with certainty in a
single ideology.

\subsection{Unity of Science}
\label{unity}

Positivism requires \cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} that belief in a theory
  does not disregard relevant evidence, merely because it was gathered
  in a different discipline from that in which the study was produced.
  For a positivist, if the products of a method of inquiry are
  applicable in one discipline, they are applicable in all
  disciplines.  A positivist will, therefore, expect that the theories
  accepted in different academic disciplines will be capable of
  concatenation into a single theory.
  
  To develop a mathematical model of this fourth characteristic of
  positivist knowledge, it will first be useful to state its meaning
  in the following natural-language terms: for theories devised in
  different disciplines to be capable of concatenation into a single
  ``theory of everything,'' all that is required is that they are not
  mutually contradictory.  It is a simple matter to give mathematical
  expression to this rule.  Consider two theories $T_1$ and $T_2$,
  which are to be concatenated into a single theory $\{T_1,T_2\}$.  If
  there is some piece of evidence $E$, for which, in response to some
  test, the performance of which is rendered possible by the
  concatenated theory, $P(E|T_1)=0$ and $P(\bar{E}|T_2)=0$, then a
  positivist will assign a prior probability $P(\{T_1,T_2\})=0$ to the
  concatenated theory.

While Shulman \cite{Shulman:1996:WWC} has made it clear that the principle
that self-contradictory theories may be assumed to be false is itself
a mathematical postulate, which may be opened to question, that
question is beyond the scope of this thesis, and possibly beyond the
scope of Bayesian statistics.  For now, it will be assumed that the
requirement of the fourth characteristic of positivist knowledge is a
weak and sensible constraint.

\section{Expanded Positivism}
\label{expanded}

Some positivists apply stricter conditions than the core conditions
(appendix \ref{core}) for entry into knowledge.  This section will
describe some of these conditions, and attempt to build mathematical
models of them, in the same way that appendix \ref{core} did for the
core conditions.

\subsection{Deterministic Falsificationism}
\label{false}

There exists \cite{Howson:1989:SRB} a version of phenomenalism
(appendix \ref{phenomenalism}) which prohibits the entry into
positivist knowledge of any theory, for which there is no conceivable
piece of observational evidence which will entirely rule out the
theory; in physics, Rutherford was \cite{Fist:1999:EPT,
McSpadden_Gardener:1999:S} a proponent of this viewpoint, asserting
that, rather than use statistics to interpret an experiment, one
should perform a new experiment which discriminated between theories
more decisively.  The Bayesian mathematical model of this is simple: a
positivist who subscribes to this view will not accept a theory $T$ as
valid, and will therefore assign to it a prior probability $P(T)=0$,
unless there is some conceivable piece of evidence $E$, for which
$P(T|E) = P(E|T) = 0$.  This restriction is unnecessary for a
Bayesian, since Bayes' theorem is capable of generating inferences
about the truth of any theory that meets the weaker version of
phenomenalism (appendix \ref{core}.)  In addition, it assigns a fixed
prior probability to theories of this type, and is therefore, as far
as these theories are concerned, an example of logical probability
(appendix \ref{prior}.)  Garrett \cite{Garrett:1988:PPS} calls this
version of phenomenalism \emph{falsifiability}, and also notes that it
is not a reasonable principle for a Bayesian to adopt.

\subsection{Exclusion of Evidence Obtained with an Ideology in Mind}
\label{no-caring-labour}

Some suggest that evidence obtained with an ideology in mind ought not
to enter into knowledge, i.e.\ {}ought not to affect one's belief in a
theory.  When Rose \cite{Rose:1983:HBH, Rose:1984:IFS} accuses science
of ignoring, on the basis of an asserted need to divide the
intellectual labour of pursuing science from manual and emotional
labour, evidence obtained, often by women, in the course of caring
labour, and in the course of self-health care and the self-examination
which renders self-health care possible, it is this addition to
positivism which she criticizes, for caring labour is necessarily the
pursuit of an ideology, in which a key value is the welfare of the
person for whom one is caring, and self-health care the pursuit of an
ideology, in which a key value is one's own physiological well-being.
Young \cite{Young:1998:WHH} has also noticed this tendency among some
positivists.  It is exemplified by the situation in research into the
environmental effects of the use of tributyltin, as a biocide, in
paint for ships' hulls, where the paint industry on the one hand, and
governments and environmental pressure groups on the other, each
attempt \cite{Swanson:2000:PUS} to dismiss research funded by the
other, as tainted by its ideological motivations.

This addition to positivism sits uneasily with the core positivist
principle of taking into account evidence obtained in disciplines
other than one's own (appendix \ref{unity},) given how easy, and
indeed how justified (appendix \ref{values},) it often is to accuse
practitioners of another discipline of pursuing an ideology.  There
exist \cite{Schaffer:1994:PAB} documented examples of apparently
traditional scientists performing experiments on their own bodies,
concerning which they could hardly have been without values.  In
addition, Swanson \cite{Swanson:2000:PUS} feels at liberty to describe
the behaviour of both sides, in the tributyltin debate, as `shoddy.'
These examples may indicate that this addition to positivism has never
been fully accepted into orthodox science\footnote{One historian of
  art \cite{Clark:1971:CPV} has gone as far as to suggest that
  research conducted, without an ideology in mind, can be understood
  as an artistic movement, which arose in the early twentieth century,
  rather than as a continuation of the earlier traditions of
  science.}.

To a Bayesian, this exclusion of ideologically-gathered evidence
represents a statement that, if evidence $E$ has been gathered with an
ideology in mind then, for all theories $T$,
\begin{equation}
P(T|E) = P(T)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{discount}
\iff{}P(E|T) = P(E)\pnc{,}\quad\textrm{unless}\quad{}P(T) = 0\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
While certain theories $T$ might predict an effect on the evidence,
due to the ideological motivation, there is no reason to suppose that
the influence will always take the very specific form of rendering
$P(E|T)$ equal to $P(E)$; indeed, equation \ref{discount} sets the
prior probability to zero for any theory which predicts that the
effect of ideological motivation on evidence obtained will take
anything other than one, very specific, form, and is therefore, with
respect to any such theory, an example of logical probability (section
\ref{prior}.)  This leads to the first similarity between Bayesian
statistics and standpoint epistemology that the author wishes to
stress: a Bayesian view requires, as does \cite{Harding:1986:SQF}
standpoint epistemology, that evidence, such as that arising from
caring labour and self-health care, which was obtained in the pursuit
of an ideology, be fully accepted into knowledge.

\subsection{Reductionism}

Reductionism, as espoused by Hawking \cite{Hawking:1997:OUR}, is
defined as the notion that the concatenated ``theory of everything,''
required by the fourth characteristic of positivist knowledge (section
\ref{unity},) will take the form of the laws of physics\footnote{The
author apologizes for any confusion caused by the fact that the
definition of ``reductionism'' here is different from that used by
Harding \cite{Harding:1986:SQF}.}.  Indeed, it has been pointed out
\cite{Penrose:1997:LSH} that Hawking \cite{Hawking:1997:OUR} appears
to propose a stronger version of reductionism, in which it will be the
presently accepted laws of physics, with their predictive ability
extended by more powerful computers and mathematical techniques, which
eventually explain the results of all disciplines.

The Bayesian model of reductionism depends on what is meant by ``the
form of the laws of physics.''  If taking the form of the laws of
physics means being sufficiently unambiguous to be capable of making
testable predictions, and failing to contradict postulates of simpler
disciplines, in which one believes simultaneously, then reductionism
is simply phenomenalism (appendix \ref{phenomenalism},) along with the
prohibition on self-contradictory theories (appendix \ref{unity}.)  If,
on the other hand, taking the form of the laws of physics means
relating observable \emph{quantities} through equations in a
mathematical language, into which not all possible natural-language
postulates can be translated, then it can be argued that reductionism
is insisting on the assignment of zero prior probabilities to the
un-translatable natural-language theories, rendering reductionism,
with respect to these theories, an example of logical
probability\footnote{The idea that not all phenomena are well
described by mathematical language is unique neither to Bayesian
inference, nor to standpoint epistemology.  Without reference to
either tradition, and in the context of astronomical observations,
Eddington \cite{Eddington:1940:EU} has made this point eloquently.}
(appendix \ref{prior}.)  A distinction between these two forms of
reductionism is also discussed by Anderson \cite{Anderson:1972:MID},
who names the former ``reductionism,'' and the latter
``constructionism.''

\chapter[Subjectivity]{The Appearance of Subjectivity in Academic
  Study}
\label{subject}

Having established that Bayesian statistical analysis departs from the
positivist epistemology, it is useful to describe the epistemological
themes with which Bayesianism is associated.  In this chapter, the
theme of the inevitable presence of subjectivity in academic study
will be developed.

\section{The Direct Role of the Prior Probability}
\label{prior}

As mentioned above (appendix \ref{core},) logical probability is
\cite{Howson:1989:SRB} a view of inference similar to the Bayesian
one, but in which a particular prior probability distribution is
regarded as objectively correct, and all others as invalid.  Modern
Bayesianism instead regards \cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} any
particular initial prior probability distribution as an arbitrary and
subjective choice\footnote{Care is needed over what is an ``initial''
  prior probability distribution.  The initial prior probability
  distribution is the $P_0(T)$ before approximate account (section
  \ref{imperfect}) has been taken of previous evidence.}.  For
example, when Patrick and Wallace \cite{Patrick:1981:SCG} undertook a
Bayesian comparison of theories of the design principles behind stone
circles, they stated, as a corollary of a set of \emph{axioms}, `A
continuous measure for the ranking of hypotheses and their evidentiary
support is the length of the message that describes an hypothesis
statement and the evidence (data) optimally encoded according to that
hypothesis.'  They derived from this a prior probability distribution
\begin{equation}
P(T) \propto{} \exp{}(-N(T))\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where $N(T)$ is the length of a computer program implementing theory
$T$.  The explicit statement of axioms is an apparent acknowledgement
of the subjectivity of this prior probability distribution.

For the author, this subjectivity of the initial prior probability
distribution is the intuitive principle that, before any evidence is
examined, there is no basis, on which to recommend as right, or
criticise as wrong, particular beliefs, save for the warning (section
\ref{phenomenalism}) against prior probability distributions that
prevent account from being taken of whatever evidence may arise, and
the provisional acceptance (appendix \ref{unity}) of a zero prior
probability for self-contradictory theories.

For a Bayesian, logical probability, and the positivist tradition,
which the author argues (appendix \ref{positivism}) is closely
associated with logical probability, do not remove this arbitrary and
subjective choice from the interpretation of evidence and the problem
of induction, but instead conceal the choice and render the chosen
prior probability distribution immutable.  It is easy to slip into the
use of an undeclared prior probability distribution: the author, in
reporting an experiment \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} designed to measure the
spin distribution of electrons from a magnetic surface, as an
intermediate step to inferring the magnetic properties of that
surface, adopted a uniform prior probability distribution, over the
ratio of the rate of electron arrival at each of the detectors in the
experiment to the rate of production of electrons for the incident
beam, without explicitly stating this.  As the author subsequently
realized, this prior probability distribution was inappropriate for
the situation, because for some of the measurements, the likelihood
was significant in regions of negative ratio, for which it would have
been reasonable to assign a prior probability much lower than that for
positive ratios.

Rather than claiming supremacy for a particular choice of prior
probability distribution, Bayesian inference allows
\cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} for the analysis of the same
evidence, from the starting points of many prior probability
distributions.  The Bayesian conception of objectivity is
\cite{Howson:1989:SRB} that a posterior probability is objective if
similar posterior probabilities arise from a wide range of prior
probability distributions.  Here, another similarity with standpoint
epistemology becomes clear, for standpoint epistemology and the new
social movements hold that the interpretation of evidence is
\cite{Flax:1983:PPP, Harding:1986:SQF} affected\footnote{The idea that
theoretical beliefs inevitably affect the interpretation of empirical
evidence is unique neither to Bayesian inference, nor to standpoint
epistemology.  Without reference to either tradition, and in the
context of astronomical observations, Eddington
\cite{Eddington:1940:EU} has made this point eloquently.}  by the
socially-generated prior beliefs of the interpreter, that objectivity
is \cite{Babbie:1979:PSR} achieved through a convergence, termed
``intersubjectivity'' and achieved by evidence-gathering, between the
views of those with different prior beliefs, and that a sufficiently
grounded theory can \cite{Flax:1983:PPP} only be achieved by combining
the sciences developed by those with different previous experiences,
in particular by people of differing gender, i.e.\ {}that many
interpretations of reality each have \cite{Smith:1981:EWP} an
important contribution to make to a complete and balanced
understanding of the world.  The different previous experiences can
(appendix \ref{imperfect}) be treated as influences on prior
probability distributions.

Once objectivity is conceived as a lack of dependence of the posterior
probability on the prior probability distribution, it is possible to
propose measures of the subjectivity of a posterior probability
$P(T_j|E)$.  One possible measure is
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{subjectivity-measure}
S(T_j|E) & = &
\sum_{T_i\in{}S}\left(\left(\frac{\td{P(T_j|E)}}{\td{P(T_i)}}\right)^2\right)\br
& = &
\sum_{T_i\in{}S}\left(\left(\frac{\delta_{ij}P(E|T_j)}{P(E)}-\frac{P(T_j)P(E|T_j)P(E|T_i)}{(P(E))^2}\right)^2\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}
It could be instructive to analyse the qualitative features of this,
and of other measures of subjectivity.
d4993 1
a4993 756
In Harding's \cite{Harding:1986:SQF, Harding:1998:ISM} codification of
standpoint epistemology, there is an apparent attempt to reach beyond
the domain in which Bayesian analysis is useful, by deciding,
qualitatively, the relative weight to be assigned to each individual's
subjective interpretation of evidence (prior probability
distribution;) the view \emph{appears} to be expressed that the
greatest weight should be given to interpretations by people who have
been excluded or marginalized by the academic enterprise.  It could be
argued that to give enhanced weight to the views of the previously
marginalized is just as undemocratic as to give enhanced weight to the
views of the previously privileged.

However, standpoint epistemology's emphasis on interpretations by the
marginalized has a purpose: the experience of a marginalized life
provides \cite{Smith:1981:EWP, Mies:1993:MFR, Harding:1998:ISM}
evidence $E_m$, which is not provided by the experience of a
privileged life, rendering \cite{Smith:1981:EWP, Mies:1993:MFR,
Harding:1998:ISM} those who have lived on the margins especially
qualified to interpret some subsequent evidence of academic interest,
particularly, although not only, in the social sciences.  For a
Bayesian, the ideal treatment of $E_m$ is the use of Bayes' theorem
(equation \ref{bayes}) to generate posterior probabilities
$P(T|E_m)$. However, $E_m$ might be in the same position as $E_0$ in
appendix \ref{imperfect}, requiring the use of an approximation method
in which, for subsequent inference, a prior probability distribution
is generated which has been adapted, in an attempt to take account of
$E_m$.  It is plausible that the experiences of the marginalized are
particularly subject to the difficulty of theories not having been
developed in such a way as to provide likelihood values for them.
Either the exact Bayesian inference, or the generation of an adapted
prior probability distribution, can be performed equally well by
others (the advantaged) as by those (the marginalized) who discovered
the evidence, so long as the latter are prepared to share their
evidence, and the former are prepared to acknowledge it.  There is
then no necessity to give enhanced weight to the views of the
previously marginalized, on the basis of their social identity.

Harding \cite{Harding:1998:ISM} is at pains to answer the criticism
that to give enhanced weight to the views of the previously
marginalized is just as undemocratic as to give enhanced weight to the
views of the previously privileged, and to this end, stresses that it
is taking account of the extra evidence available to the marginalized
which is important, and that the advantaged can do this alongside the
marginalized, so long as the latter are prepared to share their
evidence, and the former are prepared to acknowledge it.  As in the
Bayesian approach, there is no necessity to give enhanced weight to
the views of the previously marginalized.

\section{The Role of Ideology in Experiment Selection}
\label{values}

In addition to a means of drawing inferences from evidence, an
epistemology may include a way of choosing evidence-gathering tactics
(hereafter called experiments, although they may take the form of any
act of observation or inquiry.)  Often associated
\cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} with Bayesian statistics is an
experiment selection method known as statistical decision theory,
which works \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS, Chaloner:1995:BED} as follows: for
the set $S$ of available theories and the set $R_X$ of possible
results of a particular experiment $X$, an uncertainty function $U(S)$
is defined, which is a function of the prior probabilities $P(T)$,
$T\in{}S$, intended to represent the initial incompleteness of
knowledge about which theory is true.  A popular choice of uncertainty
function is \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS, Chaloner:1995:BED,
  MacKay:2001:ITI} the Shannon entropy
\begin{equation}
H(S) = -\sum_{T\in{}S}P(T)\log{}(P(T))\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The same uncertainty function of the posterior probabilities
$P(T|E)$, $T\in{}S$, $E\in{}R_X$, denoted $U(S|E)$, can \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS,
  MacKay:2001:ITI} be used to represent the remaining incompleteness
of knowledge about which theory is true, once result $E$ has been
obtained.  For the Shannon entropy,
\begin{equation}
H(S|E) = -\sum_{T\in{}S}P(T|E)\log{}(P(T|E))\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Before performing experiment $X$, the expectation value of the
uncertainty which will remain after performing experiment $X$ is
\cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS, MacKay:2001:ITI}
\begin{equation}
U(S|X) = \sum_{E\in{}R_X}P(E)U(S|E)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where the $P(E)$ are the marginal likelihoods, for the various
results.  For the Shannon entropy,
\begin{equation}
H(S|X) = -\sum_{T\in{}S}\sum_{E\in{}R_X}P(T|E)P(E)\log{}(P(T|E))\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Once all these definitions are made, one can \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS}
measure the expected worth of an experiment $X$, as the difference
between the uncertainty before the experiment is performed, and the
expected uncertainty after the experiment is performed, a quantity
known as the information
\begin{equation}
I(X;S) = U(S)-U(S|X)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
If there is a choice of several experiments, and the costs, in a broad
sense which includes any ethical disadvantages of performing an
experiment, as well as the direct financial costs and hard work
involved, are small enough to be ignored, then the experiment with the
largest information should \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS} then be chosen.
This is statistical decision theory's means of experiment selection:
it is assumed that the incompleteness of knowledge can be measured by
a function of the probability distribution over theories, then
experiments are chosen to reduce the incompleteness of knowledge as
much as possible.

Examples of the use of this statistical decision theory to choose
experiments, in the natural and social sciences, are
\cite{Chaloner:1995:BED} rare, although examples of its use to justify
a choice of experiment retrospectively are \cite{Chaloner:1995:BED}
more common.  It could be conjectured that the apparent rarity of the
use of statistical decision theory is due to the statistical nature of
natural-language arguments, used to approximate statistical arguments
(appendix \ref{natural},) not being obvious.

For the purposes of this thesis, the important aspect of statistical
decision theory is the way in which the uncertainty function is
chosen, for it is based on ideology.  The ideology is
\cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS} encoded in a loss function $L(y;T)$, which
represents how bad the condition of the universe will be if a policy
$y$, from a set $Y$ of possible policies, is chosen, given that theory
$T$ is true.  The uncertainty function is \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS} then
\begin{equation}
U(S) = \min_{y\in{}Y}\sum_{T\in{}S}P(T)L(y;T)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
i.e.\ {}how bad the condition of the universe is expected to be, from
the point of view of the ideology encoded in $L(y;T)$, if the policy
is chosen which renders the condition of the universe as good as
possible, on the basis of the prior probability distribution over
theories.  Therefore,
\begin{equation}
U(S|E) = \min_{y\in{}Y}\sum_{T\in{}S}P(T|E)L(y;T)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{associate}
U(S|X) = \sum_{E\in{}R_X}\min_{y\in{}Y}\sum_{T\in{}S}P(T|E)P(E)L(y;T)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

Not only can an uncertainty function, determining the selection of
experiments, be devised on the basis of an ideology in this way, it
has been shown that \emph{every} continuous, concave $\cap$
uncertainty function can \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS} be associated with
some loss function $L(y;T)$, and therefore with some ideology, through
equation \ref{associate}\footnote{The mapping from ideologies to
  uncertainty functions is many-to-one.  Therefore, the ideology
  associated with a given uncertainty function cannot be uniquely
  specified.}.  Therefore, a Bayesian cannot help but suspect that any
attempt to obtain knowledge without an ideology in mind (section
\ref{no-caring-labour},) far from eliminating ideology from the
academic enterprise, conceals its inevitable role in the selection of
experiments, and renders the ideology immutable.  The Bayesian
statistical decision theory, by contrast, is quite open about the role
of ideology in its experiment selection procedure.

Again, therefore, the conclusion from Bayesian statistics is the same
as that of standpoint epistemologists.  In standpoint epistemology, it
has been emphasized that, among other subjective influences, ideology
is \cite{Harding:1998:ISM} always involved in the constitution of
scientific problems and the choice of hypotheses to test; in other
words, in the selection of experiments.  Experiment selection methods
which attempt to be value-neutral are understood \cite{Fee:1981:IFT,
  Fee:1981:WNS, Harding:1986:SQF} to conceal, rather than to
eliminate, the influence of ideology on experiment selection, and
standpoint epistemologists openly choose experiments
\cite{Harding:1986:SQF, Mies:1993:MFR, Harding:1998:ISM} with the aim
of providing information resources for the implementation of
emancipatory ideologies.  For example, a research project, by the
action group ``Women Help Women,'' on physical abuse, by their
husbands, of women in Cologne, was \cite{Mies:1993:MFR} inspired by
the need for information on the extent of such abuse, to facilitate a
decision by the municipal government about whether to fund a shelter
for the victims.

In the analysis of the role of ideology in experiment selection,
moreover, standpoint epistemologists have concluded that the concealed
ideologies in much of the research, in natural and social sciences,
that has taken place over the last three centuries, have
\cite{Hubbard:1979:HOM, Harding:1998:ISM} been patriarchy and
colonialism.  The present author is not, however, prepared to assert
that all experiments in that period have been chosen on such
anti-emancipatory grounds; Strathern \cite{Strathern:1995:RIC} has
pointed out that the fact that certain procedures of the universities
are not explicitly codified does not imply that they implement
anti-emancipatory ideologies; experiment selection systems, too, must
be examined individually, rather than subjected to a universal
assumption that they are anti-emancipatory, if one wishes to discover
the ideology behind them.  Here too, statistical decision theory can
provide insights, through equation \ref{associate}, which relates the
uncertainty function, used in selecting experiments, to the loss
function, which represents the ideology behind experiment selection.
For example, the Shannon entropy, an uncertainty function which is
commonly chosen for the mathematical convenience that results from its
history as a tool for setting limits \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI} on the
performance of communication channels, rather than for its ideological
associations, is associated with a loss function in which, for any
given prior/posterior probability distribution $P(T)$, there is one
policy $y$ with loss
\begin{equation}
L(y;T) = -\log{}(P(T))\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and all other policies have a larger expectation loss than does $y$.

It is difficult to imagine that patriarchy, colonialism, or any of the
standard ideologies, could take this position of assigning goodness to
the consequences, within theory $T$, of policy $y$, based solely on
the probability $P(T)$ or $P(T|E)$ of that theory being true.  The
author believes that, rather than base experiment selection on the
Shannon entropy, which is the optimum methodology for an ideology for
which no-one, as far as he knows, has expressed support, and whose
nature and relationship to standard ideologies are unclear, it would
be more appropriate for researchers to arrange their research
transparently to assist in the implementation of ideologies in which
either they, their funding agencies, or both believe; the Shannon
entropy's undoubted importance in setting limits
\cite{MacKay:2001:ITI} on the performance of communication channels
does not imply any special position with respect to experiment
selection.

Neither the author, nor proponents of standpoint epistemology
\cite{Harding:1986:SQF} are neutral on the choice of uncertainty
function: the author would prefer the use of an uncertainty function
based on a liberal ideology, like the one set out in a convenient form
for mathematical expression by Rawls \cite{Rawls:1973:TJ}.  However,
Gibbs' inequality implies \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS, MacKay:2001:ITI}
that \emph{any} experiment has an information greater than or equal to
zero, from the point of view of \emph{any} ideology whose uncertainty
function is concave $\cap$.  Therefore, the only experiments that will
be unwelcome will be those with unacceptable intrinsic costs, moral or
financial; fortunately for the construction of a universal science,
the experiments selected by proponents of a particular ideology are
also useful to their political opponents.

\section{Other Means for Ideology to Affect Science}
\label{moreideology}

In addition to the mechanisms discussed in appendix \ref{values},
ideology may enter into academic study through attempts to produce a
posterior probability distribution, in which the policy which will
minimize the expectation of one's own loss function is the same policy
which will minimize the expectation of the loss function of someone
else with decision-making power, i.e.\ {}through research as a
coalition-building tool.

At its most sinister, this seems to be the process that Proctor
\cite{Proctor:1988:RHM} describes as the attempt by the Nazis to
`depoliticize' repressive policies against several minorities.
Harding \cite{Harding:1998:ISM}, by reference to various commentators
\cite{Shapin:1985:LAP, Rouse:1987:KPP, Pickering:1992:SPC}, and in the
context of developing standpoint epistemology, proposes as the
mechanism by which de-politicization was achieved, `the creation of a
``normal'' or ``authoritative'' science.'  A Bayesian might interpret
the phrase `a ``normal'' or ``authoritative'' science' to mean that a
single theory $T$, which, although it may have given Nazi policy $y_N$
a high $L(y_N;T)$, where $L$ is the loss function for a more moderate
ideology than the Nazis' own, claimed that the available alternative
policies $y_a$ would have loss functions $L(y_a;T)$ that were almost
as high as $L(y_N;T)$, or even higher, was held up as certainly true,
$P(T) = 1$.  If the probabilistic nature of truth is accepted, as
Bayesians recommend, such a claim of certain truth for one theory will
not seem very convincing.

The author does not, however, wish to claim that Bayesian thinking
provides infallible protection against similar deceptions by
extremists seeking to build coalitions: one obvious loophole is the
possibility of popularizing a prior probability distribution, designed
to lead to a high posterior probability for the de-politicizing
theory; if an unscrupulous researcher or politician chooses a
posterior probability distribution in advance, Bayes' theorem
(equation \ref{bayes}) can readily be inverted, to generate a
``rigged'' prior probability distribution, which, along with the
available evidence, will produce that posterior probability
distribution.  The attempt to make one theory appear certainly true is
an extreme example of this: if a theory has prior probability $1$, it
will have posterior probability $1$.  Another such loophole is the
possibility of selectively publicizing evidence, in such a way as to
lead to a high posterior probability for the de-politicizing theory.

Even for those who support more moderate ideologies, and are familiar
with the methods of Bayesian inference, it is easy to slip into the
making of a theoretical claim with little evidence, as a way of
convincing believers in other ideologies to support the policies that
serve one's own ideology.  A relatively trivial, but highly
illustrative, example, is the author's reaction to sweeping
condemnation of manufactured pop groups in general, and the recent
\htmladdnormallink{\emph{Popstars}}{http://www.popstarsonline.net/popstars/main_index.html}
television series, in the UK, which constructed such a group through a
series of televised auditions, in particular, for allegedly producing
music of poor quality.  This reaction was: even if the criteria used
to select members for a manufactured pop group are only partly based
on musical ability, such a process provides a better approximation to
fair equality of opportunity than waiting for a group to arise
spontaneously.  Therefore, in principle, one would expect manufactured
pop groups to produce better music than pop groups which arise
spontaneously.  The hidden theoretical assumption, (subconsciously)
intended to persuade those whose ideology places high worth on good
music to agree, on policy, with the author, whose ideology places high
worth on fair equality of opportunity for its own sake, is that fair
equality of opportunity is associated with high productivity.  This is
not an unreasonable assumption, but it would have been dangerous to
use it in this concealed and non-probabilistic way.

\section[Prior Probability and Experiment Selection]{The Role of the
  Prior Probability in Experiment Selection}
\label{moreprior}

Let it be supposed that there exists some absolutely true
theory\footnote{The commitment to philosophical realism involved in
  this supposition is not \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP} a requirement for
  the adoption of Bayesian statistics as an epistemology, nor is it
  necessary to any of the arguments in the rest of this thesis.}
$T_0$, which has not yet been devised, and that the current
probability distribution over theories is dominated by two theories,
$T_1$ and $T_2$.  Two experiments, $X$ and $Z$, are possible, and each
is so costly that only one can be undertaken.  The conceivable
outcomes of $X$ are labelled $E_1$ and $E_2$, and the conceivable
outcomes of $Z$ are labelled $F_1$ and $F_2$.  The content of the
theories is as follows:
\begin{equation}
P(E_1|T_0) = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(E_2|T_0) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(F_1|T_0) = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(F_2|T_0) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(E_1|T_1) = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(E_2|T_1) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(F_1|T_1) = \frac{1}{3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(F_2|T_1) = \frac{2}{3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(E_1|T_2) = \frac{1}{3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(E_2|T_2) = \frac{2}{3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(F_1|T_2) = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
P(F_2|T_2) = 0\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

When the likelihoods are marginalized over the set $S = \{T_1,T_2\}$
of available theories,
\begin{equation}
P(E_1) = P(T_1)+\frac{P(T_2)}{3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(E_2) = \frac{2P(T_2)}{3}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P(F_1) = \frac{P(T_1)}{3}+P(T_2)\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
P(F_2) = \frac{2P(T_1)}{3}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

If the Shannon entropy is used as uncertainty function, the
information of experiment $X$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
I(X;S) & = & I(S;X)\br
& = & H(X)-H(X|S)\br
& = &
-\left(P(T_1)+\frac{P(T_2)}{3}\right)\log\left(P(T_1)+\frac{P(T_2)}{3}\right)-\frac{2P(T_2)}{3}\log\left(\frac{2P(T_2)}{3}\right)\br
& &
+P(T_2)\left(\frac{2}{3}\log\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{3}\log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right)\br
& = &
-\frac{1}{3}(1+2P(T_1))\log\left(\frac{1}{3}(1+2P(T_1))\right)-\frac{2}{3}(1-P(T_1))\log\left(\frac{2}{3}(1-P(T_1))\right)\br
& & +(1-P(T_1))\left(\frac{2}{3}\log\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{3}\log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right)\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
and that of experiment $Z$ is 
\begin{eqnarray}
I(Z;S) & = & I(S;Z)\br
& = & H(Z)-H(Z|S)\br
& = &
-\left(P(T_2)+\frac{P(T_1)}{3}\right)\log\left(P(T_2)+\frac{P(T_1)}{3}\right)-\frac{2P(T_1)}{3}\log\left(\frac{2P(T_1)}{3}\right)\br
& &
+P(T_1)\left(\frac{2}{3}\log\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{3}\log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right)\br
& = & -\frac{1}{3}(3-2P(T_1))\log\left(\frac{1}{3}(3-2P(T_1))\right)-\frac{2P(T_1)}{3}\log\left(\frac{2P(T_1)}{3}\right)\br
& &
+P(T_1)\left(\frac{2}{3}\log\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{3}\log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\input{self-interest}
\end{makeimage}
\caption{Graph of the Information of the Experiments $X$ and $Z$
against the Prior Probability of Theory $T_1$.}
\label{self-interest}
\end{figure}
If the prior probability $P(T_1) > \frac{1}{2}$, then (figure
\ref{self-interest}) $I(X;S) > I(Z;S)$, and experiment $X$ is chosen,
with result $E_1$.  This gives posterior probabilities, according to
Bayes' theorem (equation \ref{bayes},)
\begin{eqnarray}
P(T_1|E_1) & = & \frac{P(T_1)}{P(T_1)+P(T_2)/3}\br
& = & \frac{3P(T_1)}{1+2P(T_1)}\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
and 
\begin{eqnarray}
P(T_2|E_1) & = & 1-\frac{3P(T_1)}{1+2P(T_1)}\br
& = & \frac{1-P(T_1)}{1+2P(T-1)}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

Similarly, if the prior probability $P(T_1) < \frac{1}{2}$, then
(figure \ref{self-interest}) $I(X;S) < I(Z;S)$, and experiment $Z$ is
chosen, with result $F_1$.  This gives posterior probabilities,
according to Bayes' theorem (equation \ref{bayes},)
\begin{eqnarray}
P(T_1|F_1) & = & \frac{P(T_1)}{3P(T_2)+P(T_1)}\br
& = & \frac{P(T_1)}{3-2P(T_1)}\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
and 
\begin{eqnarray}
P(T_2|F_1) & = & 1-\frac{P(T_1)}{3-2P(T_1)}\br
& = & \frac{3-3P(T_1)}{3-2P(T_1)}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

The process that is taking place is starkly illustrated by a graph
(figure \ref{enhancement}) of the posterior probability of $T_1$,
$P(T_1|E_1)$ or $P(T_1|F_1)$, against its prior probability, $P(T_1)$:
the theory that has the higher prior probability is able to make one
experiment, which tends to confirm it, appear more interesting than
the other experiment, which tends to refute it, and thereby to enhance
its probability further.
\begin{figure}
\begin{makeimage}
\input{enhancement}
\end{makeimage}
\caption{Graph of the Posterior Probability of $T_1$ against Its Prior
Probability}
\label{enhancement}
\end{figure}

While this statistical result does not relate specifically to any
principle in standpoint epistemology, Kuhn's \cite{Kuhn:1970:SSR}
recent epistemological observation, `Normal research\ldots{} owes its
success to the ability of scientists regularly to select problems that
can be solved with conceptual\ldots{} techniques close to those
already in existence,' could be interpreted as a similar phenomenon,
particularly since Kuhn's view of the normal research process is one
in which strong belief in a theory also tends to be stable belief in
that theory.

An investigation of the possibility that this phenomenon can arise
with an absolutely true theory that is non-deterministic, or even
without the need to use the content of an as yet undiscovered,
absolutely true theory at all, will be of considerable interest.  An
investigation of the possibility that this phenomenon can arise with
uncertainty functions derived from more realistic ideologies than that
associated with the Shannon entropy will also be of considerable
interest.

\chapter[Experiment Selection in Modern Physics]{Experiment Selection
  in Modern Physics: Size, Energy, and Complication}
\section{Size and Energy}
\label{size}

Having established some philosophical properties of Bayesian
statistics, it is time to apply some Bayesian insights to current
directions in the physical sciences.  The first such insight relates
to the greedy top-down method of experiment selection (section
\ref{greedy}.)

This provides a Bayesian model of Poincar\'e's argument, articulated
by Pirsig \cite{Pirsig:1999:ZAM}, that scientists choose to measure
processes very far away in space or in time, because these provide the
highest probability of a result other than the expected one; in other
words, because they have a high value of the Shannon entropy, or of
some similar function, over the marginal likelihoods.

This incentive for scientists to measure processes on very large
length scales also applies to very small length scales, a process that
Pirsig \cite{Pirsig:1999:ZAM} identifies in biology.  This provides
two directions in which science has \cite{Coleman:2000:FSE} moved, in
the attempt to draw more robust inferences about the truth of
theories: to larger length scales, and to smaller length scales.  The
latter is \cite{Rae:1992:QM, Gasiorowicz:1996:QP}, according to
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, equivalent to moving to higher
energies.

\section{Complication Is Different}
\label{complexity}

In this section, some Bayesian insights will be brought to bear on the
study of condensed-matter physics.
  
In addition to increasing and decreasing length scales (section
\ref{size},) Anderson \cite{Anderson:1991:ICP} and Coleman
\cite{Coleman:2000:FSE} have pointed out that there is a third way, in
which scientists, and particularly physicists, have recently begun to
seek out evidence, to draw more robust inferences about theories,
namely measuring processes of greater complication.  While biological
and social scientists have long studied very complicated systems,
there is still a substantial niche, including \cite{Anderson:1972:MID}
the study of solid state physics, for physical scientists to fill,
before the three disciplines start competing directly.
  
There seem to be two conflicting approaches to the physics of
complication.  The first approach is that which has led to numerical
band-structure calculations in solid-state physics: the ``first
principles'' of quantum mechanics, or some well-understood
approximation thereto, are given to a computer, along with a precise
specification of the atomic-scale configuration of the material, and
computational resources are used to make theoretical predictions about
observable characteristics of the material.  In solid-state physics,
this approach is at the end of a process of implementing Schr\"odinger
equations with ever more realistic approximations to the Hamiltonian.
Such an approach has \cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
  M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS} been used, with a series of choices for
the approximation to quantum mechanics, and the atomic configuration,
to predict properties of layered structures of manganese, cobalt, and
copper.
  
Anderson \cite{Anderson:1972:MID} points out a difficulty with this
approach: any system, more complicated than a molecule of four atoms
or so, is pretty well never in an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, so
the Schr\"odinger equation doesn't describe the state of the system.
This is because the tunnelling-like processes, which would otherwise
collapse the system into an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, are very
slow for complicated systems: often very slow compared with the age of
the universe, and certainly very slow compared with the rate of
occurrence of measurement-like interactions with the outside world,
which collapse the system into eigen-states of operators other than
the Hamiltonian.  Therefore, it can't be guaranteed that the model
which implements a Schr\"odinger equation with the most realistic
Hamiltonian will always be the most useful in describing the real
behaviour of the system.  Anderson \cite{Anderson:1972:MID} intended
this principle to apply generally to the relationship between any
discipline and a successful theory in a slightly simpler discipline,
not just to that between solid state physics and quantum mechanics.
  
The second approach is that of emergent phenomena
\cite{Anderson:1991:ICP, Coleman:2000:FSE}, in which the theories used
have postulates other than the ``first principles'' of quantum
mechanics, which can make testable predictions, without stretching
computing capacity to its limits in the way that band-structure
calculations do, perhaps succeeding in encoding the various atomic
configurations in continuous, analytical parameters, such as the
roughness parameters in ``Correlation between dynamic magnetic
hysteresis loops and nanoscale roughness of ultrathin $Co$ films''
\cite{Jiang:1996:CDM}, or the classical electric potentials and
magnetic flux densities in chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}.
  
These postulates may either be derived rigorously from statistical
properties of quantum mechanics, in which case the postulates are not
really new, just a re-encoding of those of quantum
mechanics\footnote{The assignment of cases where the new postulates
  are derived rigorously from statistical properties of quantum
  mechanics to the ``emergent phenomena,'' rather than to the ``first
  principles,'' tradition is somewhat arbitrary; this choice has been
  made here to generate a clear distinction in Bayesian statistical
  properties.}, or may be introduced on an \emph{ad hoc} basis,
usually with the use of some clues from quantum mechanics, or some
approximation thereto, such as classical mechanics.
  
Here, it is argued that there is a second difficulty with the ``first
principles'' approach: in band-structure calculation, there are many
plausible choices of the precise atomic configuration, i.e.\ {}many
possible theories of similar form, for which it is
\cite{MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA} therefore reasonable to assign
similar prior probabilities; when many theories have similar prior
probabilities, those prior probabilities will \cite{MacKay:1992:BI,
  MacKay:1992:BMA} be small.  Therefore, although the greater use of
the clues available from quantum mechanics, in ``first principles''
theories, renders it reasonable to assign a higher prior probability
to the disjunction of all ``first principles'' theories, than to a
similarly rich disjunction of ``emergent phenomena'' theories, each
individual atomic configuration in the ``first principles'' theories
will have a tiny prior probability.

This matters because the introduction of a numerical-computational
method prevents the use of a likelihood for the observed data,
expressed as an analytical function of a continuous parameter, which
represents which of the many possible choices is considered, and
forces the likelihood to be evaluated individually for each precise
configuration.  Given realistic computing resources, one cannot do
this for all the possible configurations\footnote{Even the sterling
  work of researchers such as Lind et al. \cite{Dunning:1985:ESP,
    Lind:1987:SSA}, in running band-structure calculations for
  multiple proposed structures for a particular sample, barely
  scratches the surface.  However, current developments
  \cite{Heap:2003:CRT} in technology for enabling members of the
  public to donate CPU time may change this.}, and many will therefore
end up in the situation outlined in appendix \ref{imperfect}, i.e.\ 
{}all of the available evidence will be in the position, which appears
to be identified with the experiences of the marginalized in
standpoint epistemology (appendix \ref{prior}.)  It is reasonable to
suppose that the disjunction of the small number of atomic
configurations, for which the band-structure calculation can be
completed, will not have a very large prior probability compared with
an ``emergent phenomena'' theory, the microscopic variability of which
is encoded in continuous, adjustable parameters, in terms of which an
analytical likelihood formula can be obtained.
  
There are four possible responses to this situation.  The first is to
use the encoding of evidence, for which likelihoods are not accurately
known, in a prior probability distribution, described in section
\ref{imperfect}.  However, this kind of guesswork about the inferences
which can be drawn from evidence is only intended as a short-term,
interim solution, while deductions from theories are allowed to catch
up with experiment.  The application of band-structure calculations,
even to the most relevant, relatively few, atomic configurations,
seems set to be a very long-term project indeed.
  
The second is to attempt to model the predictions for atomic
configurations, for which the numerical band-structure calculations
have not been performed, by some distribution about the predictions
resulting from those for which the band-structure calculations have
been performed, this distribution representing an added postulate in
the ``first principles'' theory.  However, the predictions for one
configuration cannot easily be used as a guide to the predictions for
similar configurations; certainly, in the study of magnetic films,
small changes in atomic arrangement and in approximation method can
lead to substantial changes in observed properties, both
experimentally \cite{Jiang:1996:CDM, Dodd:1997:CCS}, and in the
calculations \cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
  M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS}.  Therefore, the selection of the
distribution about the known results, which is to be added to the
``first principles'' theory is a non-trivial task, and might in itself
require a process of inference from experimental evidence, to choose
between distributions.  Also, this will leave the likelihood
distribution $P(E|T)$, for those theories $T$ that are treated in this
way, with a substantial Shannon entropy, rendering the greedy top-down
approximation to Bayesian experiment selection (appendix \ref{greedy})
useless.
  
The third is to undertake inference with the theories for which
predictions are available, effectively assigning a zero prior
probability to those atomic configurations for which the
band-structure calculations have not yet been performed, and leaving
the specific ``first principles'' theories for which the
band-structure calculations have been performed with their small prior
probabilities, and the adjustable ``emergent phenomena'' theories with
their large prior probabilities.  However, it is not (section
\ref{no-caring-labour}) entirely satisfactory to assign zero prior
probabilities to theories, the existence of which, if not their
details, is known.
  
The fourth is to ignore the evidence, for which some theories have not
predicted likelihoods, until such time as the theoretical deductions
are complete.  However, it is not entirely satisfactory to ignore such
a large body of evidence, for the length of time that would be
involved in this mammoth theoretical project.

\chapter[Approximation Methods]{Approximation Methods in Bayesian
  Inference and Experiment Selection}
\label{approx}
\section[Imperfect Theories]{Inference with Imperfect Theories: The
  Evidence-Based Prior Probability Distribution}
\label{imperfect}

This section is concerned with a scenario where a Bayesian has
gathered evidence $E_1$, and wishes to draw inferences on the basis
thereof, about the truth or falsehood of theory $T$, having previously
noted other evidence $E_0$.  Ideally, the prior probability used in
Bayes' theorem
\begin{equation}
P(T|E_1) = \frac{P(E_1|T)P(T)}{P(E_1)}
\end{equation}
would (appendix \ref{bayes-intro}) be
\begin{eqnarray}
P(T) & = & P(T|E_0)\br
& = & \frac{P(E_0|T)P_0(T)}{P_0(E_0)}\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
where $P_0(T)$ is an initial, arbitrary (appendix \ref{prior}) prior
probability distribution, and $P_0(E_0)$ is the marginal likelihood
(appendix \ref{bayes-intro}) calculated on the basis of $P_0(T)$.

However, it may be found that some theories $T$ have not been
developed in such a way as to generate values of $P(E_0|T)$, rendering
this ideal method impossible\footnote{Kuhn's \cite{Kuhn:1970:SSR}
  description of certain pieces of evidence, which he terms
  ``\emph{mere} facts'' (Kuhn's italics,) could be interpreted as a
  statement that those pieces of evidence are in this position.}.  In
these cases, Bayesians often use \cite{Howson:1989:SRB} prior
probability distributions $P(T)$, which attempt to estimate
$P(T|E_0)$, taking account of $E_0$ in an approximate way, when they
attempt to make inferences from $E_1$.  The author has considered
using this technique to take account of visual impressions from
electron diffraction patterns, in determining the crystal structure of
manganese-cobalt multi-layers.

\section{The Greedy Top-Down Method of Experiment Selection}
\label{greedy}

When the Shannon entropy (appendix \ref{values}) is used as uncertainty
function,
\begin{eqnarray}
I(X;S) & = & I(S;X)\br
& = & H(X)-H(X|S)\pnc{,}
\end{eqnarray}
and $H(X)$ is, therefore, sometimes used as an approximate guide to
the worth of an experiment $X$, the approximation being equivalent to
an assumption that theories with significant prior probabilities each
predict one result for the experiment with near certainty, and that
$H(X|S)$ is therefore small; MacKay \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI}, in the
contexts of simple measurement problems, and of the construction of
codes for data compression, has named this approximation the `greedy
top-down method.'

The author's description (chapter \ref{motive}) \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}
of the motivation, for polarized electron reflection experiments on
$Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ multi-layers, in terms of the continuing uncertainty
over the magnetic moments of manganese atoms in these structures,
could be considered an example of a natural-language version (appendix
\ref{natural}) of a greedy top-down experiment selection method.

\section[Natural Language]{Natural-Language Arguments in Experiment
  Selection}
\label{natural}

As has been \cite{Keynes:1937:GTE} pointed out, in the context of
economic decisions in a market-place, it will not always be possible
to make even an approximate quantitative estimate of the expected
merits of different courses of action, under an ideology, leading to
the necessity for a natural-language description of the features of
decisions that are good, under that ideology, to allow qualitative
arguments to be put forward.  It is plausible that this also applies
to experiment selection.  Therefore, it may be useful to put forward
qualitative conditions for an experiment to lower an uncertainty
function (appendix \ref{values}) significantly.

In a recent application to attend a \htmladdnormallink{summer school
  in geo-physical and environmental fluid
  dynamics}{http://gefd-www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/}, the author suggested
that a situation where policy-makers have apparently similar values,
but are unable to agree on the policy to adopt, may indicate that the
source of the divergence of policy is disagreement about the
consequences of any particular policy, and that experiments that
distinguish between theories about the consequences of each of the
policies proposed in the debate have a high information.  He held up
the process that began with the Kyoto protocol, and ended in failure
to reach a treaty acceptable to all parties, although a wide variety
of governments shared qualitative features of a value system, in which
possible consequences of failing to reduce carbon emissions, such as
coastal flooding, and increased frequency of extreme, local weather
events, are seen as nefarious, but must be weighed against the moral
good of economic growth, which efforts to reduce carbon emissions may
jeopardize, as an example of such a situation.

electron energies greater than $\sim{}60\ut{eV}$, where the Taylor
expansion allows the latter to make quantitative predictions, the
reflected beam polarization from a nickel $(001)$ surface is
independent of incident electron energy and of angle of incidence.
Several other band-structure theories for $Ni(001)$, with different

I promised to comment on some assumptions in this analysis.  Firstly,
there's the matter of modelling the electrons as a plane wave.  This

something I've done in the binomial expansion anyway.  The same
convention of neglecting this deflection was adopted by Weber et al.
\cite{Weber:1999:EAF}, when they analysed the spin polarization of
transmitted electron waves.

Secondly, there's the issue of pretending that all electron spin
directions are eigen-states of the Hamiltonian.  In this I depart from
the tradition of analysis of PNR, where matrices are

However, I don't propose this model as a replacement for the one

reflection model, to experimental data, and use the well-established
\cite{MacKay:1992:BMA} methods of Bayesian statistics, first to infer

can be placed in each model.

complicated than a molecule of four atoms or so, is pretty well never
in an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, so the Schr\"odinger equation
doesn't describe the state of the system.  This is because the
tunnelling-like processes, which would otherwise collapse the system
into an eigen-state of its Hamiltonian, are very slow for complicated
systems: often very slow compared with the age of the universe, and
certainly very slow compared with the rate of occurrence of
measurement-like interactions with the outside world, which collapse
the system into eigen-states of operators other than the Hamiltonian.
Therefore, it can't be guaranteed that the model that implements a
Schr\"odinger equation with the most realistic Hamiltonian will always
be the most useful in describing the real behaviour of the system.

\label{motive}

Colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory had earlier performed a series
of measurements on the system formed by growing a $0.5\ut{ML}$
$Mn/6\ut{ML}$ $Co/Cu(001)$ multi-layer \cite{Choi:1998:FTD,
  Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  Low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) revealed, through the existence of $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$
order spots, a $c(2\times{}2)$ (chessboard-like) superstructure in the
plane of the film.
d1209 4

Three possible explanations were advanced for the $c(2\times{}2)$
superstructure \cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}:

\item Inter-diffusion of copper atoms through the cobalt layer may
  have led to the formation of a $MnCu$ surface alloy
  \cite{Wuttig:1993:MDB, Kraan:1995:GSS}.  However, these experiments
  were performed at room temperature, which is too cold to permit
  significant inter-diffusion through $6ML$ $Co$ \cite{Kief:1993:GST}.
  This suggestion was therefore ruled out.
\item The manganese may have had an internal $c(2\times{}2)$
  anti-ferromagnetic configuration.  However, the measured
  $(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ spot intensity was $\sim 10$ times that
  predicted for magnetic diffraction of this type by Tamura et
  al.~\cite{Tamura:1988:DSA}.  This phenomenon is therefore incapable
  of providing a complete explanation of the observed superstructure.
\item An ordered $MnCo$ surface alloy may have been formed.  Given the
  evidence against the other two models, the observed diffraction
  pattern was attributed to $MnCo$ alloy formation.

Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements were taken by
colleagues at the Cavendish Laboratory as part of the same project
\cite{Choi:1998:FTD, Choi:1999:MAS, Choi:1999:SMP}.  The $[110]$
direction, easy axis Kerr signal was seen to increase with the
addition of manganese, in the regime where the alloy exists.  The
immediate reaction to this is that the system's magnetic moment is
increasing, i.e. that the manganese atoms that are being added are
ferro-magnetically aligned, both with each other and with the cobalt.
However, the simultaneous drop in $[100]$ Kerr signal did not paint
the same picture, and it may be that a change in magneto-optical
response, rather than a genuine addition of magnetic moments, is
responsible for the increased $[110]$ signal.  The possibilities are
in particular need of investigation, given that a series
\cite{Noguera:1996:VTF, Meza-Aguilar:2001:TDS,
  M'Passi-Mabiala:2002:FGS} of numerical calculations, using different
approximations, have produced widely differing predictions about the
magnetic properties of this system.

The polarization of a reflected electron beam from the sample surface
provides an alternative to MOKE for measuring the magnetization
through the difference, for the two electron spins, in density of
states at a particular energy created by the exchange splitting, and
as such provides an experiment which is interesting by virtue of
having an unpredictable result.  The experiments presented in this
thesis, using a $Co/Cu(001)$ structure, are intended as an
intermediate stage on the way to similar measurements on
$MnCo/Co/Cu(001)$, although they could equally well lead to similar
measurements on other multi-layer structures of more direct industrial
relevance, such as metal/ferromagnet or semiconductor/ferromagnet spin
valves.  This possibility may help to address the conclusions,
concerning the motivation for experimental research projects, of the
statistical research in appendices \ref{values}, \ref{greedy}, and
\ref{natural}.

In addition, the measurements for $Co/Cu(001)$, in themselves, allow a
trial run of estimating the parameters in the theory of chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft}, and comparing a version of that theory, in
which no Weiss field affects the probing electrons, against another
version, in which an adjustable Weiss field affects the probing
electrons.  This task is undertaken in appendix
\ref{relegated-bayesian-stuff}.

One cannot conclude from this that the theory in chapter
\ref{hatton-2002-cft} is a bad fit to the data, for three reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}In the author's, not entirely uncontroversial
  \cite{Hancock:1998:CCP}, view, the goodness of fit of a theory $T$
  to data $E$, as measured by the likelihood $P(E|T)$ (appendix
  \ref{discussion-likelihood}, appendices \ref{bayes-intro},
  \ref{phenomenalism}, \ref{occam}, \ref{prior},) or any other method,
  is a relative measurement.  That is to say, a theory can only be
  called a bad fit to a set of data if its likelihood or other
  goodness of fit measure is substantially lower than those of other
  theories.  As far as the author is aware, the only available theory
  of polarized electron reflection at a surface is that in chapter
  \ref{hatton-2002-cft}; while the adjustability of this theory is
  such that different versions of it can be tested against one another
  for goodness of fit (appendix \ref{adaptive-models},) there is no
  possibility to test its global goodness of fit against any other
  theory.
\item{}The notion that the directions of the changes in electron
  arrival rates at the two channeltrons, on magnetization reversal,
  are particularly salient features of the data set, results from a
  process of visual pattern recognition, which is personal to the
  author.  While sensory pattern recognition processes of this nature,
  known to psychologists as ``gestalt,'' play \cite{Kuhn:1970:SSR}
  several important r\^oles in the physical sciences, there is no
  guarantee that the features of the data that they select as most
  important will be those that have the greatest effect on the
  likelihood in any given theory.
\item{}The estimates of the directions of arrival rate change,
  presented in table \ref{movement-directions} are themselves visual
  impressions, which (in some cases more than others) may be open to
  question.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, it is suggested that, in terms of the diagrammatic view of

\chapter[Repeated Adaptation List]{List of Adaptations to the
  Polarimeter, and to the Measurement Technique, from \emph{Mott
    Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory} \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}}
\label{repeated-adaptation-list}

\begin{itemize}
\item{}Significant cross-talk was discovered between the signal output
  cables on the two channeltrons; this was largely eliminated by the
  installation of improved shielding within the polarimeter.
\item{}The high voltage supply used to accelerate the electrons toward
  the thorium target was found to be unreliable; there was a
  considerable delay in the diagnosis of this fault due to the
  difficulty of finding a reasonably safe means of measuring the
  required potential difference of many $\ut{kV}$.  Once the supply
  had been discovered to be producing only $750\ut{V}$, replacement of
  the offending control potentiometer was rapidly effected.
\item{}The channeltrons are \cite{::CEM} designed as single-electron
  counting devices, intended to function by using an electrostatic
  field to accelerate an incoming electron into a collision, which
  liberates further electrons from the channeltron walls, which are in
  turn accelerated to produce further collisions.  This process
  amplifies a single electron into a current pulse containing
  $\sim{}10^8$ electrons, which is readily detectable using a digital
  counter.  However, the count rates measured by this method were
  found to be anomalously low.  This is believed to be because the
  rate, at which electrons were arriving at the channeltrons, was
  substantially above the saturation rate ($\sim{}10^4\ut{Hz}$,) at
  which the channeltrons' detection efficiency begins to drop rapidly
  with increasing electron arrival rate.  This was the case with
  specularly reflected beams of energies between $\sim{}2\ut{keV}$ and
  $\sim{} 3\ut{keV}$ from magnetic and non-magnetic surfaces, even for
  the smallest incident beam currents available.  Therefore, it was
  necessary to make adaptations to allow the use of the front ends of
  the channeltrons as Faraday cups, the current collected at which
  could be measured as a continuous flow, rather than as discrete
  electron arrival events.  To this end, an ammeter of sufficient
  sensitivity to measure the currents involved (of order $1pA$) was
  procured, and a wire which connected the front ends of the two
  channeltrons, possibly allowing flow of current between them, was
  removed.
\item With the high voltage supply to the thorium foil in operation,
  continuous current measurement revealed current spikes, occurring at
  a frequency of $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$, peaking at what later transpired to
  be approximately the steady current, which was obtained in
  successful measurements.  The spikes were set against a background
  of substantially lower current, and were also detected as pulses in
  single electron counting mode, whether or not an accelerating
  potential difference was applied across the channeltrons.  This is
  now believed to have been a consequence of the electrical connection
  to the thorium foil and surrounding assembly from outside the vacuum
  chamber having some freedom of movement inside its insulating
  casing, leading to a situation in which there was good electrical
  contact only for brief periods, occurring at $\sim{}3\ut{Hz}$,
  producing the spikes that represented the current in the intended
  operating condition.  The effect has disappeared since the
  mechanical security of the connection was improved.
\item Calculation of raw asymmetries
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},+} = \frac{f_{+,1}-f_{+,2}}{f_{+,1}+f_{+,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
A_{\textrm{raw},-} = \frac{f_{-,1}-f_{-,2}}{f_{-,1}+f_{-,2}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
from the measurements \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC} on the reflected beam
from $Cu/Mn/Co/Cu(001)$ shows larger uncertainties, and slightly
poorer consistency between the two runs of the experiment than the
results from the use of the formula (equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}) for the elimination of
multiplicative systematic errors, suggesting that the multiplicative
errors do exist, and were subject to drift over the period between the
two runs of the experiment, and that the use of the formula, with the
polarization reversal achieved using opposite remanent magnetization
directions of the film structure, was a necessary measure.
\item The difficulty of adjusting the zero on the ammeter used for
  continuous current measurements, given its slow response both to the
  zeroing control and to changes in the current which it was
  measuring, led to a suspicion that there might be additive offsets
  which would require a fitting procedure of the kind introduced in
  \emph{Mott Polarimetry at the Cavendish Laboratory}
  \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}.  The non-zero and variable values obtained
  for the channeltron currents at zero incident beam current, using
  this procedure, indicate that such offsets do exist, and are subject
  to drift; therefore, both the fitting procedure and the time
  ordering of the experiments were necessary precautions.

Only some qualitative pointers to theories that \emph{might} better
match the contents of table \ref{movement-directions} will be

testing of new theories, in the light of data, will be left as an
exercise for any reader who wishes to undertake it.

  front of the polarimeter (the $a$ of section \ref{adaptive-models}.)
  In support of this explanation, it is noted that, since the position
  of the sample is only reset on changes of magnetization or of film
  thickness, one would expect, if it were the correct explanation,
  that the direction of change of the count rate would be independent
  of channeltron number and beam current, depending only on film
  thickness, as is (table \ref{movement-directions}) indeed observed
  in almost all cases.  However, there are two strong arguments
  against this explanation.  Firstly, the precision with which the
  sample was positioned was chosen on the basis of empirical evidence
  (appendix \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}) about the precision needed
  to prevent this effect.  Secondly, the overall proportions of ``up''
  and ``down'' directions of change of electron arrival rate, on

models (chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}, section \ref{adaptive-models},)
in the light of future experimental results, with the experimental
method adapted to position the sample more precisely, to be quicker,
or to avoid switching on and off the channeltrons.  However, if more
quantitative theories are constructed, based on the, apparently more
plausible, third explanation, they will provide an exciting
possibility for using electron beams to probe magnetic surfaces
without relying on spin polarization effects.  The data in chapter
\ref{results} would be immediately suitable for use in this process,
but future experimental data could be gathered without the practical
difficulties involved in Mott polarimetry.  It is also possible that
the future of magnetism measurements with electron beams will take a
course that the author has not foreseen; either one for which the
measurements in chapter \ref{results} are useful, or one for which
they are not useful.

several examples \cite{Lind:1986:ETC, Lind:1987:SSA, Weber:1999:EAF}
of published data, obtained using Mott polarimeters, on the spin
polarization of reflected, diffracted, transmitted, and secondary
electron beams from magnetic and non-magnetic materials, these all
present the data in a processed form, similar to that of section
\ref{traditional-estimation-section}, rather than in the raw form of
chapter \ref{results}.  This is understandable, given the length
constraints of journal articles, but regrettably, renders it
impossible to apply reasoning of the kind above to these data.

\section{Statistical Inference Process}
\label{adaptive-models}

In this section, the data presented in chapter \ref{results} will be
used to estimate the values of the adjustable parameters in two models
of the system of samples and measuring apparatus, and to compare the
two models.  The framework used for this data interpretation will be
Bayesian inference (appendix \ref{bayes-intro}) \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP,
  Howson:1989:SRB, MacKay:1992:BI, MacKay:1992:BMA, MacKay:2001:ITI,
  MacKay:2002:ITI}.
d1959 2
a1960 4
In this process, definitions of some standard probability density
distributions will be useful.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The Dirac delta function is such that
d1962 1
a1962 1
\delta{}(x) = 0\pnc{,}
d1964 1
a1964 36
for $x \neq{} 0$, and
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}\delta{}(x)\td{x} = 1\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
for any $\epsilon > 0$.  This probability distribution expresses the
certainty that $x = 0$.
\item{}The Gaussian probability distribution is
\begin{equation}
G(x; \mu{}, \sigma{}) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{}\left(-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
This probability distribution is a standard default, much beloved
\cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} of the physics community, for
the distribution over a parameter $x$, knowledge of which can be
summarized by an expected value $\mu$ and a degree of variation
$\sigma$ about the expected value.
\item{}A perfect top-hat function is
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = \frac{1}{h-l}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
\begin{equation}
T_0(x; l, h) = 0\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
otherwise.  This probability distribution expresses the certainty that
a parameter $x$ lies between $l$ and $h$, and has equal probability of
lying in any fixed-width subset of that domain.  It is useful, for
example, where $x$ is a probability, and therefore must lie between
$0$ and $1$, or where $x$ is a measurement, quantized in units $h-l$
with an unknown origin by a digital meter, of a parameter
$\frac{h+l}{2}$.  In the rest of this section, an adapted version of
the perfect top-hat
\begin{equation}
T(x; l, h)\frac{127}{128(h-l)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
if $l \leq{} x \leq{} h$, and
d1966 1
a1966 1
T(x; l, h) = G\left(x; \frac{h+l}{2}, \frac{h-l}{5.32}\right)\pnc{,}
d1968 2
a1969 12
otherwise, is used.  This distribution has a probability
$\frac{127}{128}$ of being in the top-hat region, and a probability
density outside this region equal to a Gaussian of appropriate width
\cite{Manura:2002:M, ::ESH} for the probability integrated over this
region to be $\frac{1}{128}$.  Not only is this a more realistic
belief density than a perfect top-hat, it provides a probability
density gradient outside the top-hat region, which will help the
leapfrog proposal density (section \ref{monte-carlo}) to reduce the
random walk behaviour of the metropolis method.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Framework of the Models}
d1971 1
a1971 101
Both models are based on the theory of polarized electron reflection
from a bulk sample presented in chapter \ref{hatton-2002-cft}.  The
use of a model intended for a bulk sample is justified on the basis
that the inelastic mean free path of electrons, of the energies used
in this experiment, is \cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF} no more
than $\sim{}1\ut{nm}$, with the result that even rather thin films
will appear, when examined with an electron beam, to be bulk
materials.

Therefore, when the beam current into the electron gun is $F$, the
rate of electron incidence on the sample is $F/e$, and the rate of
electrons leaving the sample, in the reflected beam (figure \ref{sd},)
is, from integration of equation \ref{reflected-amplitude},
\begin{equation}
\label{reflected-intensity}
G = \left(\frac{e^2V^2}{16E_b^2\cos^4I}+\frac{e^2\hbar^2B^2}{192m_e^2E_b^2\cos^4I}\right)\frac{F}{e}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The polarization of the reflected beam is, from equation
\ref{polarization},
\begin{equation}
P = -\frac{4e^2\hbar{}m_eV_1B_1}{12e^2m_e^2V_1^2+e^2\hbar^2B_1^2}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The electrostatic potential, $V$, and the magnetic flux density, $B$,
in the sample, are adjustable parameters of the model.  In fact, since
there are eight cobalt film thicknesses, including zero thickness
(table \ref{recorded-growth-conditions},) there are multiple
parameters of this type, $V_j$ and $B_j$, with the film thicknesses
indexed by integers $j$, from $0$ to $7$ inclusive.  These then lead
to electron leaving rates $G_j$ and reflected polarizations $P_j$.

Since the entrance hole of the polarimeter (figure \ref{sd}) is of
finite width, it is possible that not all of the electrons in the
reflected beam will enter the polarimeter.  Therefore, an acceptance
probability $a$ is defined, so that the rate of electrons entering the
polarimeter is $aG_j$.  The entrance hole and grids are assumed to be
non-polarizing, with the result that the polarization of the beam
entering the polarimeter is $P_j$.

The thorium foil then scatters electrons towards the two channeltrons.
The rate of electron arrival at channeltron $1$ will be, by equation
\ref{r1},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(1, j)} = \Gamma{}(1+SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and that at channeltron $2$ will be, by equation \ref{r2},
\begin{equation}
f_a^{(2, j)} = \Gamma{}(1-SP_j)aG_j\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where the spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma$ and the
Sherman function $S$ are characteristics of the thorium foil.
Calibration values of $\Gamma$ and $S$ for a Mott polarimeter, of
identical design to that used for these experiments, have been
provided by other workers \cite{Burnett:1994:HER}, and those for
electrons with energy $20\ut{keV}$ are reproduced in figures
\ref{HER_Average} and \ref{HER_Sherman}.  Although the energy of the
electrons on striking the thorium foil, in the experiments presented
in this thesis, is $(20.5\pm{}0.00725)\ut{keV}$, not $20\ut{keV}$, the
systematic error introduced by this energy difference
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} is negligible, compared with the quantization
error of the author's readings from the published graphs (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood}.)

  loss window $W$, from the calibration data for the compact
  retarding-potential Mott polarimeter, provided in ``High-efficiency

  deviations associated with the quantization of the author's readings
  from the published graph.}

  quadrature of the standard deviation associated with the
  quantization of the author's readings from the published graph, and
  the error quoted on the published graph.}
\label{HER_Sherman}
\end{figure}

The published calibration data are for electron energies, on striking
the thorium foil, of $20\ut{keV}$ and $25\ut{keV}$, and are presented
as a function of the energy loss window $W$, defined by the potential
at the retarding grids (chapter \ref{compact}.)  The author has chosen
to include the published data for a $20\ut{keV}$ energy, on striking
the thorium foil, in the data set (section
\ref{discussion-likelihood},) from which inference is to proceed, and
to characterize the thorium foil by by twelve adjustable parameters,
$\Gamma_k$ and $S_k$, where $k$ runs through integers from $0$ to $5$
inclusive,
d1973 2
a1974 2
\label{Gammamodel}
\Gamma = \sum_{k=0}^5\Gamma_kW^k\pnc{,}

a1979 2
\label{Smodel}
S = \sum_{k=0}^5S_kW^k\pnc{.}
d1981 4
a1984 252

These fifth order Taylor expansions are an extension, to calibration
data that include relatively large energy loss windows, of the spirit
of the first and second order Taylor expansions in ``Use of thorium as
a target in electron-spin analyzers'' \cite{McClelland:1989:UTT}.  The
fifth order has been chosen to provide a number of adjustable
parameters, in each Taylor expansion, that is the largest integer less
than or equal to half the number of calibration data points, in line
with MacKay's \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI, MacKay:2002:ITI} recommendation
for the number of parameters in neural network models.

Channeltron $i$ (figure \ref{channeltron},) used in single-electron
counting mode in these experiments, has a detection efficiency
$\eta_i$, adjusted by a time-dependent perturbation $p_{ij}$ to allow
for drift (appendix \ref{july-2002-experiments}.)  Since the speed of
the present experiments has been chosen so that the drift should not
be significant within the time-scale of measurements on a single film
thickness, each channeltron has just one $p_{ij}$ value for each film
thickness; the subscript $j$, as before, indexes the film thickness.
Therefore, the electron detection rate at the channeltron $i$, from
film thickness $j$, is predicted to be
\begin{equation}
\label{predicted-detection-rate}
f_p^{(i, j)} = p_{ij}\eta_if_a^{(i, j)}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
The $p_{ij}$ and $\eta_i$ values are further adjustable parameters of
the model.

\subsection{Prior Probability Distributions}
\label{discussion-prior}

Bayesian estimation of the parameters in a model, on the basis of
experimental data, requires \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP, MacKay:1992:BI,
  MacKay:1992:BMA} the explicit statement of prior probability
distributions, representing the beliefs that are held about the
parameters, before the experimental data are examined.  The author has
made some remarks about the importance of this requirement in appendix
\ref{prior}.  The prior probability distributions for this problem are
presented in tables \ref{priortable} and \ref{priortable2}.

\caption{Parameters in the Main Model, with Their Prior Probability

\label{priortable2}
\end{sidewaystable}

Justifications for these prior probability distributions follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}For the acceptance probability $a$, a uniform distribution over
  the range from $0$ to $1$ seems sensible, given that we know very
  little about the properties of this system, other than that the
  energy loss window at the front of the polarimeter is (table
  \ref{polarimeter-voltages}) held constant throughout the
  experiments.
\item{}The author and collaborators performed (appendix
  \ref{july-2002-experiments}) experiments, before those described
  here, which provided a rough estimate of the extent of the drift in
  the channeltron detection efficiencies.  The magnitude of the drift
  was found to be $\sim{}10\%$ peak-to-peak , on a typical time-scale
  of the order of a few hours.  The time-scale is represented in the
  division of the data set into chronologically contiguous subsets,
  which, by the design of the present experiment, coincide with single
  film thicknesses, and the magnitude in the standard deviation of the
  prior probability distributions over the time-dependent
  perturbations $p_{ij}$.
\item{}The scattering probability $\Gamma$ at the thorium foil must be
  in the range between zero and one, leading to the top-hat form for
  the distribution over $\Gamma_0$.
\item{} In the distributions over $\Gamma_k$, $k > 0$, the typical
  range of variation of the scattering probability over the energy
  scale of the experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor
  expansion, is asserted to be one.
\item{}The Sherman function $S$ at the thorium foil must be in the
  range between $-1$ and one, leading to the top-hat form for the
  distribution over $S_0$.
\item{}In the distributions over $S_k$, $k > 0$, the typical range of
  variation of the Sherman function over the energy scale of the
  experiments, due to any one term in the Taylor expansion, is
  asserted to be two.
\item{}Because the front ends of the channeltrons are earthed, the
  electrons reach them with the same kinetic energy that they have at
  the sample.  This means that the energies of the electrons, on
  arrival at the channeltrons, will range from $250\ut{eV}$ to
  $1500\ut{eV}$.  The detection efficiencies of channeltrons of the
  type used, in this energy range, are \cite{::CEM} between $0.78$ and
  $0.89$.  Therefore, a top-hat probability distribution, with these
  as its limits, is used for $\eta_i$.  The author does not believe
  that it is worthwhile to create an energy-dependent model, since the
  uncertainty in the efficiency, at a particular energy, is
  \cite{Bordoni:1971:CEM, ::CEM} comparable with its variation with
  energy, over this range.
\item{}It can be assumed that, in as much as the sample is believed to
  be bulk, the bulk material in question is, for $j > 0$, cobalt, or,
  for the clean sample $j = 0$, copper, because the meaning of
  ``bulk'' is ``topmost layer too thick for the electron beam to
  penetrate,'' i.e.  of a thickness that is large compared with 1nm
  \cite{Childs:1995:HAE, Weber:1999:EAF}.  Therefore, the
  electrostatic potential $V_j$ is expected to be the difference in
  expected work function between stainless steel, which is the
  material from which the front end of the electron gun, which sets
  the zero of potential for the electrons, is constructed, and copper
  for $j = 0$, or cobalt for other film thickness indices $j$.  The
  width of the distribution of $V_j$ can be estimated by combining in
  quadrature the random errors $\Delta\Phi_l = 0.05\Phi_l$
  \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} in measured work functions for the
  materials.  The work functions are $\Phi_{SS} = 4.1\ut{V}$ for
  stainless steel \cite{:2001:KPF}, $\Phi_{Cu} = 4.65\ut{V}$ for
  copper \cite{:2001:PTE}, and $\Phi_{Co} = 5\ut{V}$ for cobalt
  \cite{:2001:PTE}.
\item{}For the copper surface $j = 0$ in the main model, and for all
  film thickness indices $j$ in the null model, there are assumed to
  be no magnetic effects; the magnetic flux densities $B_j$ acting on
  the electrons, in these cases, are certainly zero.
\item{}The magnetic flux density $B_j$ that affects the electrons is
  expected to be the same effective field, originating in the exchange
  interaction \cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE}, which creates
  ferro-magnetism.  For the samples with a cobalt surface, $j > 0$, in
  the main model, a prior expectation of zero will be used, with the
  width of the prior probability distribution, i.e. the typical size
  of the flux density, being given by the order-of-magnitude estimate
  $\frac{k_Bm_eT_c}{e\hbar}$ of the strength of this Weiss field that
  can \cite{Ashcroft:1976:SSP} be obtained from the Curie temperature
  $T_C$.  This is the only difference between the null and main
  models.
\end{itemize}

The parameters are taken, a priori, to be independent.  Therefore, the
prior probability density of the parameter vector
\begin{eqnarray}
\vc{Q} & = & (Q_1,Q_2,\ldots{},Q_{47})\br
& = &
(a,p_{10},\ldots{},p_{17},p_{20},\ldots{},p_{27},\Gamma_0,\ldots{},\Gamma_5,S_0,\ldots{},S_5,\eta_1,\eta_2,\br
& & V_0,\ldots{},V_7,B_0,\ldots{},B_7)
\end{eqnarray}
is
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\vc{Q}|M_n) & = & \prod_{m=1}^{47}P(Q_m|M_n)\br
& = &
P(a|M_n)\left(\prod_{i=1}^2\prod_{j=0}^7P(p_{ij}|M_n)P(\eta_i|M_n)P(V_j|M_n)P(B_j|M_n)\right)\br
& & \times\left(\prod_{k=0}^5P(\Gamma_k|M_n)P(S_k|M_n)\right)\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

There are also prior probabilities of each model, with any set of
parameter values.  These are taken to be
\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_N) & = & P(M_M)\br
& = & \frac{1}{2}\pnc{.}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{The Likelihood}
\label{discussion-likelihood}

The data set $D$ is the disjunction of the set $D_0$ of results of the
present experiments (chapter \ref{results},) the set $D_{\Gamma}$ of
published $\Gamma$ calibration data (figure \ref{HER_Average},) and
the set $D_S$ of published $S$ calibration data (figure
\ref{HER_Sherman}.)

For each measured electron arrival rate $f_m^{(i, j)} \in{} D_0$, the
expectation of $f_m^{(i, j)}$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$,
is $f_p^{(i, j)}$ (equation \ref{predicted-detection-rate},)
calculated using parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, and the values of $E_b$
and $F$ pertaining to the data point in question.  There are two
known, significant sources of uncertainty in this prediction.  The
first results from the Poisson process \cite{Boas:1983:MMP} of
discrete electron arrivals at the channeltron, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}}$, where $256\tau$ is the time interval, over
which electrons are counted to obtain the arrival rate $f_m^{i, j}$.
The second results from the standard deviation uncertainty
$\Delta{}F$, in the incident beam current $F$, and introduces into the
measured arrival rate a standard deviation $\frac{f_p^{(i,
    j)}\Delta{}F}{F}$.  These are combined in quadrature to give an
overall standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,
      j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i, j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}$.  The
likelihood function is then taken to be
d1986 2
a1987 3
P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q}) = G\left(f_m^{(i, j)}; f_p^{(i, j)},
  \sqrt{\frac{f_p^{(i,j)}}{256\tau{}}+\frac{f_p^{(i,
        j)2}\Delta{}F^2}{F^2}}\right)\pnc{.}
d1989 1
a1989 41
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_0|\vc{Q}) = \prod_{f_m^{(i, j)}\in{}D_0}P(f_m^{(i, j)}|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured spin-averaged scattering probability $\Gamma_E \in{}
D_{\Gamma}$, the expectation of $\Gamma_E$, with a given parameter
vector $\vc{Q}$, is $\Gamma$ (equation \ref{Gammamodel},) calculated
using the $\Gamma_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value of $W$ relevant to
$\Gamma_E$.  The uncertainty is introduced by the quantization, in
units of $q_{\Gamma} = 0.001$, of the author's readings from the
published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs.  This gives
\begin{equation}
P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q}) = T\left(\Gamma_E; \Gamma{}-\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2},
  \Gamma{}+\frac{q_{\Gamma}}{2}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
\begin{equation}
P(D_{\Gamma}|\vc{Q}) =
\prod_{\Gamma_E\in{}D_{\Gamma}}P(\Gamma_E|\vc{Q})\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

For each measured Sherman function $S_E \in{} D_S$, the expectation of
$S_E$, with a given parameter vector $\vc{Q}$, is $S$ (equation
\ref{Smodel},) calculated using the $S_k$ from $\vc{Q}$, and the value
of $W$ relevant to $S_E$.  As well as the published
\cite{Burnett:1994:HER} uncertainty $\Delta{}S_E$, uncertainty is
introduced by the quantization, in units of $q_S = 0.025$, of the
author's readings from the published \cite{Burnett:1994:HER} graphs:
the standard deviation associated with this is
$\frac{q_S}{\sqrt{12}}$.  These are combined in quadrature, to give a
standard deviation $\sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}$.  The
likelihood is then taken to be
\begin{equation}
P(S_E|\vc{Q}) = G\left(S_E; S,
  \sqrt{\Delta{}S_E^2+\frac{q_S^2}{12}}\right)\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
For a given parameter vector, the measurements are assumed to be
independent:
d1991 2

\subsection{Posterior Probability Distribution}
\label{discussion-posterior}

The posterior probability distribution over the parameters in the null
model (tables \ref{priortable}, \ref{priortable2}) $M_N$ is given by
Bayes' theorem (equation \ref{bayes}:)
\begin{equation}
P(\vc{Q}|D, M_N) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_N)}{P(D|M_N)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where

P(D|M_N) = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}P(\vc{Q}|M_N)P(D|\vc{Q})\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}

Similarly, for the main model,

P(\vc{Q}|D, M_M) = \frac{P(D|\vc{Q})P(\vc{Q}|M_M)}{P(D|M_M)}\pnc{,}

\subsection{Parameter Estimation and Model Comparison}
\label{monte-carlo}

The posterior probability distributions of section
\ref{discussion-posterior} constitute a complete description of the
author's beliefs about the models and their parameters, once the data
(chapter \ref{results}) are taken into account.  However, it is a very
unwieldy description, consisting as it does of two scalar fields
defined on a $47$-dimensional space.  A summary is required for
presentation.  The author believes that the most useful summary will
be to give, for each parameter $Q_m$, estimates of its posterior
marginal expectations
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_N> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_N)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
<Q_m|D, M_M> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_mP(\vc{Q}|D, M_M)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and of its posterior marginal standard deviations,
d2032 1
a2032 1
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_N) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_N>-<Q_m|D, M_N>^2}
d2034 2
a2035 1
and
d2037 1
a2037 1
\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_M) = \sqrt{<Q_m^2|D, M_M>-<Q_m|D, M_M>^2}\pnc{,}
d2039 1
a2039 1
where
d2041 1
a2041 2
<Q_m^2|D, M_n> = \int_{\textrm{All }\vc{Q}\textrm{
    space}}Q_m^2P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)\td{^{47}\vc{Q}}\pnc{.}
d2044 2
a2045 29
The summary should also include the estimates of the model posterior
probabilities $P(M_n|D)$ (equations \ref{null-posterior},
\ref{main-posterior}.)

If a means can be found of drawing samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}$ from the distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$, where $i$ runs
from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to $J$, and the total number of
samples is, therefore, $IJ$, $<Q_m|D, M_n>$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH}
be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^JQ_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)}}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}
Similarly, $\sigma{}(Q_m|D, M_n)$ can \cite{Gallagher::MFH} be
estimated by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n)}
=\sqrt{\frac{IJ(\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
      i)}-(\bar{Q_m}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)})^2)}{IJ-1}}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
and
d2047 1
a2047 2
\bar{Q_m^2}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J((Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n,
  i, j)})^2)}{J}\pnc{.}
d2049 4
a2052 207

Similarly, if a means can be found of drawing samples
$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i, j)}$ from the distribution
$P(\vc{Q}|M_n)$, where $i$ runs from $1$ to $I$, $j$ runs from $1$ to
$J$, and the total number of samples is, therefore, $IJ$, $P(D|M_n)$
can \cite{Gallagher::MFH} be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n)} =
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i)}}{I}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\bar{L}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i)} = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^jP(D|\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, i, j)})}{J}\pnc{.}
\end{equation}

All of these estimators are \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} non-Bayesian,
i.e.~they coincide exactly with Bayesian posterior expectations of the
quantities being estimated, given the samples, only for specific, but
not specified, prior probability distributions over moments of the
distribution $P(\vc{Q}|D, M_n)$.  The estimators will, therefore,
differ by an amount $\delta$ from the posterior expectations that
would be obtained with explicit statements of plausible prior
probability distributions over these moments, if this were technically
feasible.  Fortunately, however, the size of $\delta$ tends (equation
\ref{subjectivity-measure}) to decrease with decreasing marginal
likelihood, i.e.~with increasing number of samples.  Equally
fortunately, when the inference process aims to estimate moments of a
probability distribution, from samples from that distribution, a
critical $\delta$ for each moment is made available, by the degree of
variation implied by the higher moments, such that significantly
smaller values of $\delta$ can be safely ignored.  All this means
that, for large numbers of samples, the non-Bayesian estimators are
acceptable.

The means of obtaining samples is the leapfrog method.  This is
explained in detail in \emph{Information Theory, Inference and
  Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, where it is attributed
to Skilling.  Each iteration of the method consists of the application
of a leapfrog proposal density, followed by the application of a
Metropolis decision algorithm.  For sampling from the posterior
probability distribution, after the $i$th iteration, the method's
state is a set of $J$ parameter vectors $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  j)}$, which are the samples to be used in the estimators.  The
leapfrog proposal density sets
\begin{equation}
\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)} = 2\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i,
  k)}-\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}\pnc{,}
\end{equation}
where, for each $j$, a $k$ is chosen at random from the other $J-1$
integers from $1$ to $J$, with each of these being equi-probable.  The
Metropolis decision algorithm then works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}if $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
    M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)} \geq{} 1$, then
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set to
    $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$.  Otherwise,
  \item{}$\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i+1, j)}$ is set at random, either
    to $\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$, or to
    $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}$, with probability
    $1-\frac{P(\vc{Q}'^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D,
      M_n)}{P(\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, i, j)}|D, M_n)}$.
\end{itemize}
An analogous process is used to draw samples $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri},
  n, i, j)}$ from the prior probability distribution.

As part of the preparation of the present thesis, the author has
written Perl code that implements the leapfrog method; in the
transparent copy of this thesis, the code for the null model $M_N$ is
in the file \patio{null}, and the code for the main model $M_M$ is in
the file \patio{main}.  As far as the author has been able to
discover, the present thesis is the first use of the leapfrog method
to infer parameters and model likelihoods from real experimental data.
Some further details are needed to define the particular version of
the leapfrog method used in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Initial vector sets $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)}$ and
  $\vc{Q}^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ are chosen, centred around the
  analytically-derived prior expectation values $<Q_m|M_n>$ of the
  parameters.  The displacements of the $J$ initial vectors from the
  prior expectation are picked randomly from a perfect top-hat
  distribution out to a maximum size of each displacement component,
  which is the product of a constant factor $\alpha_{pri}$ or
  $\alpha_{pos}$, and the prior standard deviation $\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n)$
  of the relevant parameter.  That is to say, $Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n,
    0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{,}
\]
and $Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution
\[
T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pos}, n, 0, j)};
<Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
<Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n))\pnc{.}
\]
It has \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} been shown that the leapfrog method
rapidly grows an initial vector set that is narrower than the
distribution, from which one wishes to sample.  However, the author
does not know of any analogous proof that the algorithm can shrink an
initial vector set that is broader than the distribution, from which
one wishes to sample.  Therefore, the initial vector set, for sampling
from the prior probability distribution is made a factor of
$\exp{}(1)$, in each dimension, narrower than the prior probability
distribution.  An attempt is made to achieve the same for the
posterior probability distribution, using a guess at the width of the
posterior probability distribution.  This gives $\alpha_{pri} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\exp{}(1)}$, and $\alpha_{pos} =
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{(|D|-A)\exp{}(1)}$, where $|D| = 1018$ is the number
of data points, and the number of adjustable parameters is $A = 39$
for the null model $M_N$, and $A = 46$ for the main model $M_M$,
because a parameter whose prior probability distribution is a Dirac
delta function is not truly adjustable.  One further complication is
that it is necessary to ensure that, in each dimension, the width of
the initial vector set is comfortably greater than the quantum of
floating point numbers of the order of magnitude of $<Q_m|M_n>$.
Mantissae have 53 bits `on typical hardware' \cite{Ramirez:2002:PD}.
One bit is assumed to be taken up by the sign, and four bits are left,
to provide 16 possible starting ordinates, i.e.~if the half-width of
the top-hat distribution is less than $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$, it is
adjusted to $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$.
\item{}The author believes that the number $J$ of state vectors
  maintained simultaneously, in the Monte Carlo algorithm, must be at
  least the number $A$ of adjustable parameters.  This is because
  every state vector ever obtained will be some linear combination of
  the $J$ initial state vectors, and to obtain a representative
  sample, the $J$ initial state vectors must, therefore, span the
  parameter space.  In this thesis, therefore, $J = 2A$ is chosen,
  rather than the $J = 6$ or $J = 12$ suggested in \emph{Information
    Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms} \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}.
\item{}The author also believes that having a large value of $J$ will
  ameliorate the problem, noted by MacKay \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI}, of
  the state vectors in the leapfrog algorithm becoming stuck
  permanently at one vector set, after it has converged, because, as
  long as the parameter of interest varies smoothly in $\vc{Q}$ space,
  as the $Q_m$ must, if $J$, there will be a reasonable sampling of
  the distribution even if all the individual state vectors are
  stationary.  $P(D|\vc{Q}, M_n)$, however, might not vary smoothly is
  $\vc{Q}$ space.  Therefore, the estimates of $P(D|M_n)$ obtained
  herein should be treated with some scepticism.

Bayesian inference process described in section \ref{adaptive-models}.
Note that the estimator could be re-derived, as the expectation value
of $SP$ in a Bayesian model with appropriate assumptions.  This would
have the advantage of allowing these assumptions, which would be made
explicit by the Bayesian approach, to be examined for plausibility,
and changed if necessary (see also appendix \ref{prior}.)
Unfortunately, the model would be a model \emph{of} the reflected
beam, not of the sample, and therefore successful estimation of its
parameters does not further the aim of determining characteristics of
the sample.

After the preliminary experiment described in \emph{Mott Polarimetry
  at the Cavendish Laboratory} \cite{Hatton:2000:MPC}, considerable
resources were devoted to equipment repairs, and to safety-related
upgrades.  Once this was done, concerted efforts began to produce more
decisive polarized electron reflection measurements than those in that
report, starting with pilot experiments on $Co/Cu(001)$ structures,
without the added manganese.  In the first such experiment, the method
was very similar to that in chapter \ref{method}, with the significant
differences being that the channeltrons were used as Faraday cups,
measuring continuous currents, instead of counting individual
electrons, and that the position of the sample was only set to a
precision of $1\ut{mm}$ in translational degrees of freedom, and
$1^{\circ}$ in the rotational degree of freedom with the vertical
rotation axis.  The results are displayed in table \ref{intthick1} and
figures \ref{20011205_Polarimetry}, \ref{20011205_Polarimetry_2},

this for all the possible configurations, and many will therefore end
up in the situation outlined in appendix \ref{imperfect}, i.e.\ {}all
of the available evidence will be in the position, which appears to be
identified with the experiences of the marginalized in standpoint
epistemology (appendix \ref{prior}.)  It is reasonable to suppose that
the disjunction of the small number of atomic configurations, for
which the band-structure calculation can be completed, will not have a
very large prior probability compared with an ``emergent phenomena''
theory, the microscopic variability of which is encoded in continuous,
adjustable parameter, in terms of which an analytical likelihood
formula can be obtained.

\cite{Johnson:1996:MAM} the magnetizations of film structures to be
in-plane, and experiments confirm \cite{Krams:1992:MAU} that the
permanent magnetization in $Co/Cu(001)$ is in-plane.  The existence of
sudden steps in electrostatic potential is supported by a comment in
\emph{Calculated Electronic Properties of Metals}
\cite{Moruzzi:1978:CEP}, although this book is concerned primarily
with bulk materials, and there is the possibility that steps, which
are sudden on the scale of bulk materials, may be gradual on the scale
of electron de Broglie wavelengths.  I suspect that such a possibility
would be easily detectable in the experiments, because there would be
no reflection without a sudden potential step.

  However, there are two strong arguments against this explanation.
  Firstly, the precision with which the sample was positioned was
  chosen on the basis of empirical evidence (appendix
  \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}) about the precision needed to prevent
  this effect.  Secondly, the overall proportions of ``up'' and
  ``down'' directions of change of electron arrival rate, on

  related to switching on and off the channeltron, rather than to a
  particular time-scale.  In support of this explanation, it is noted
  that, as long as the drift effects relate to switching on and off
  the channeltrons, which occurs only at changes of magnetization

  correct explanation, that for a given film thickness, the direction
  of change of the count rate would be independent of channeltron
  number and beam current, depending only on film thickness, as is
  (table \ref{movement-directions}) indeed observed in almost all
  cases.  However, there are three strong arguments against this
  explanation.  Firstly, the speed, with which the experiments were

  some ferromagnetic part of the sample holder (figure
  \ref{sample-holder},) may be deflecting the electron beam in such a
  way as to change the acceptance probability at the front of the
  polarimeter (the $a$ of section \ref{adaptive-models}.)  In support
  of this explanation, it is noted that one would expect, if it were
  the correct explanation:

adjustable parameters than the model in section \ref{adaptive}, and
therefore to take (appendix \ref{autumn-2001-experiments}) a
prohibitive amount of CPU time to fit to the data using a Monte Carlo
method.  With reluctance, because it would have the consequence of
leaving evidence in the position described in appendix \ref{imperfect}
long-term, it might, therefore, be necessary to set aside the existing
experimental results (chapter \ref{results},) and instead assess the
existing models (chapter \ref{per-theory}, section
\ref{adaptive-models},) in the light of future experimental results,
with the experimental method adapted to position the sample more
precisely, to be quicker, or to avoid switching on and off the
channeltrons.  However, if more quantitative theories are constructed,
based on the, apparently more plausible, third explanation, they will
provide an exciting possibility for using electron beams to probe
magnetic surfaces without relying on spin polarization effects.  The
data in chapter \ref{results} would be immediately suitable for use in
this process, but future experimental data could be gathered without
the practical difficulties involved in Mott polarimetry.  It is also
possible that the future of magnetism measurements with electron beams
will take a course that the author has not foreseen; either one for
which the measurements in chapter \ref{results} are useful, or one for
which they are not useful.

  prior expectation are picked randomly from a top-hat distribution
  out to a maximum size of each displacement component, which is the
  product of a constant factor $\alpha_{pri}$ or $\alpha_{pos}$, and
  the prior standard deviation $\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n)$ of the relevant
  parameter.  That is to say, $Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)}$ is drawn
  from a distribution $T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pri}, n, 0, j)};
  <Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
  <Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pri}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n)$, and $Q_m^{(\textrm{pos},
    n, 0, j)}$ is drawn from a distribution $T_0(Q_m^{(\textrm{pos},
    n, 0, j)}; <Q_m|M_n>-\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n),
  <Q_m|M_n>+\alpha_{pos}\sigma{}(Q_m|M_n)$.  It has
  \cite{MacKay:2002:ITI} been shown that the leapfrog method rapidly
  grows an initial vector set that is narrower than the distribution,
  from which one wishes to sample.  However, the author does not know
  of any analogous proof that the algorithm can shrink an initial
  vector set that is broader than the distribution, from which one
  wishes to sample.  Therefore, the initial vector set, for sampling
  from the prior probability distribution is made a factor of
  $\exp{}(1)$, in each dimension, narrower than the prior probability
  distribution.  An attempt is made to achieve the same for the
  posterior probability distribution, using a guess at the width of
  the posterior probability distribution.  This gives $\alpha_{pri} =
  \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\exp{}(1)}$, and $\alpha_{pos} =
  \frac{\sqrt{3}}{(|D|-A)\exp{}(1)}$, where $|D| = 1018$ is the number
  of data points, and the number of adjustable parameters is $A = 39$
  for the null model $M_N$, and $A = 46$ for the main model $M_M$,
  because a parameter whose prior probability distribution is a Dirac
  delta function is not truly adjustable.  One further complication is
  that it is necessary to ensure that, in each dimension, the width of
  the initial vector set is comfortably greater than the quantum of
  floating point numbers of the order of magnitude of $<Q_m|M_n>$.
  Mantissae have 53 bits `on typical hardware' \cite{Ramirez:2002:PD}.
  One bit is assumed to be taken up by the sign, and four bits are
  left, to provide 16 possible starting ordinates, i.e.~if the
  half-width of the top-hat distribution is less than
  $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$, it is adjusted to $2^{-48}|<Q_m|M_n>|$.

  made\footnote{Kolakowski \cite{Kolakowski:1993:OVP} does not
  unambiguously identify the entities whose number is to be minimized
  as postulates.  However, both Jeffreys \cite{Jeffreys:1961:TP} and
  Rae \cite{Rae:1992:QM} interpret the positivist Occam's razor as a
  principle of fewest postulates.}.  In positivism, theories with few
  postulates are preferred to theories with many postulates.  This
  meant, for example, that before observations, such as
  \cite{Rae:1992:QM, Gasiorowicz:1996:QP} that of the photo-electric
  effect in metals, were made which were incompatible with Newton's
  laws of classical mechanics, positivism would have favoured
  classical mechanics, which has \cite{Glauert:1960:PD} two
  independent postulates, to quantum mechanics, which needs

which are described may include the consequences of particular
actions, but the desirability or otherwise of those consequences is a
matter for speculation outside of positivist knowledge.  In other
words, in terms of the definitions being used here (chapter

nor ideology-theory mixtures, which include both postulates and

To develop a mathematical model of this fourth characteristic of
positivist knowledge, it will first be useful to state its meaning in
the following natural-language terms: for theories devised in
different disciplines to be capable of concatenation into a single
``theory of everything,'' all that is required is that they are not
mutually contradictory.  It is a simple matter to give mathematical
expression to this rule.  Consider two theories $T_1$ and $T_2$, which
are to be concatenated into a single theory $\{T_1,T_2\}$.  If there
is some piece of evidence $E$ for which, in response to some test, the
performance of which is rendered possible by the concatenated theory,
$P(E|T_1)=0$ and $P(\bar{E}|T_2)=0$, then a positivist will assign a
prior probability $P(\{T_1,T_2\})=0$ to the concatenated theory.

has been shown that \emph{every} continuous, concave uncertainty
function can \cite{DeGroot:1962:UIS} be associated with some loss
function $L(y;T)$, and therefore with some ideology, through equation
\ref{associate}\footnote{The mapping from ideologies to uncertainty
  functions is many-to-one.  Therefore, the ideology associated with a
  given uncertainty function cannot be uniquely specified.}.
Therefore, a Bayesian cannot help but suspect that any attempt to
obtain knowledge without an ideology in mind (section

colonialism.  This is not to say that all experiments in that period
have been chosen on such anti-emancipatory grounds; Strathern
\cite{Strathern:1995:RIC} has pointed out that the fact that certain
procedures of the universities are not explicitly codified does not
imply that they implement anti-emancipatory ideologies; experiment
selection systems, too, must be examined individually, rather than
subjected to a universal assumption that they are anti-emancipatory,
if one wishes to discover the ideology behind them.  Here too,
statistical decision theory can provide insights, through equation
\ref{associate}, which relates the uncertainty function, used in
selecting experiments, to the loss function, which represents the
ideology behind experiment selection.  For example, the Shannon
entropy, an uncertainty function which is commonly chosen for the
mathematical convenience that results from its history as a tool for
setting limits \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI} on the performance of
communication channels, rather than for its ideological associations,
is associated with a loss function in which, for any given

the consequences, within theory $T$, of policy $y$, based on the
probability $P(T)$ or $P(T|E)$ of that theory being true.  The author
believes that, rather than base experiment selection on the Shannon
entropy, which is the optimum methodology for an ideology for which
no-one, as far as he knows, has expressed support, and whose nature
and relationship to standard ideologies are unclear, it would be more
appropriate for researchers to arrange their research transparently to
assist in the implementation of ideologies in which either they, their
funding agencies, or both believe; the Shannon entropy's undoubted
importance in setting limits \cite{MacKay:2001:ITI} on the performance
of communication channels does not imply any special position with
respect to experiment selection.

which will use the matrix representation of the reflection

a replacement for the one presented here, but as a complement to it.
What I suggest is to subject both models, along with a third,
completely classical, reflection model, to experimental data, and use
the well-established \cite{MacKay:1992:BMA} methods of Bayesian
statistics, first to infer the parameters of magnetic flux density,
electric potential, and layer thickness, for each model, then to judge
the relative confidence which can be placed in each model.

chosen because there is a broad maximum in S (equation \ref{xsec}) for
metal foils at a scattering angle of around $120^{\circ}$
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Electrons are focused onto the thorium target by
the electrostatic grids and lenses at the front of the device (figure
\ref{sd},) and are accelerated to energies between $20\ut{keV}$ and
$25\ut{keV}$, suitable for the required low impact parameter scattering
(section \ref{so}), by an electrostatic potential applied at the
thorium foil \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  An electrostatic potential applied
at the retarding grids (figure \ref{sd}) turns back electrons which
have lost more than some specified amount of energy, chosen by setting
the retarding grid potential, during the scattering process (this
energy loss window is typically between $500\ut{eV}$ and $1.5\ut{keV}$)
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This eliminates a large proportion of multiply
scattered electrons, for which the analysing power $S$ (equation
\ref{asymmean}) is reduced, without the reduction in the total
cross-section $\sigma _0$ (equation \ref{xsec}) which is brought about
by using a thin film target to reduce multiple scattering
\cite{Dunning:1987:UTG}.

d498 45

benefits \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  This, coupled with the relatively small
target potential of $\sim 22kV$, which restricts the inter-electrode
distances needed to avoid electrical breakdown, keeps the instrument
small (the distance between the two channeltrons is $\sim 10cm$)
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}, which is convenient for its attachment to a
vacuum chamber for experiments (chapter \ref{xpt}) and for development
and maintenance.  In addition, the closeness of the channeltrons to
the target, and the large solid angle which they therefore subtend,
allows for a high total scattering cross-section $\sigma _0$ (equation
\ref{xsec}) \cite{Dunning:1994:MEP}.  The relatively low energy of
electrons incident on the thorium foil (figure \ref{sd}) also
increases $\sigma _0$.

The differential cross-section as a function of scattering angle in
Mott scattering, i.e. the scattering of electrons by nuclei at small
impact parameters, exhibits a dependence on the electron spin
direction \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.  As Kessler
\cite{Kessler:1976:PE, Kessler:1985:PE} points out, in addition to simplifying
the potential calculation, the use of small impact parameters,
i.e. high energies and large scattering angles, increases the
analysing power of the polarimeter as a result of the
$\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}$ dependence of the spin-orbit correction
(equation \ref{spinorb}.)  The mechanism for this can be understood
classically as the additional term in the scattering potential
resulting from the torque exerted on the electron's spin magnetic
moment by the magnetic field due to the presence of a moving, charged
nucleus in the electron's rest frame \cite{Gay:1992:MEP,
Dunning:1994:MEP}.  Gay \& Dunning \cite{Gay:1992:MEP} and Dunning
\cite{Dunning:1994:MEP} have developed a quantitative version of this model
for a single scattering nucleus, which results in the expression for
the spin-dependent potential contribution

Therefore, from measurements of the electron arrival rates or

the form of the asymmetry \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP}.

it has traversed in the magnetic layers.  This will result in a
spin-dependent amplitude reflection coefficient for the whole
multi-layer system, which will provide the weightings to go into the
incoherent superposition over an unpolarized incident beam.  This
incoherent superposition, as for the bulk sample, will give the

\ref{single_step}.)  Next, we need to discover the amplitude
reflection coefficient, for a pure, coherent, electron wave, at a
single step (figure \ref{single_step}.)  The incident and transmitted
electron waves are modelled as plane waves, with well-defined
wave-vector components $p$ in the plane of the interface, and $q_i$
perpendicular to the interface.  $p$ must be the same for all the
waves, in order to satisfy the boundary condition of continuity of the
wave-function at the interface.  Strictly, the eigen-states of a
Hamiltonian which includes a magnetic field are not plane waves; more
about this later (section \ref{incomplete}.)  The amplitude reflection
coefficient is \cite{Rae:1992:QM} this:

I have a big enough ego to call them the Hatton numbers, but I suspect
I wouldn't get away with it.  $S_i$ is the angle between the electron
spin direction and the magnetic flux density in region $i$, and $E$ is
the total energy of the incident electrons, and therefore, by
conservation of energy, of all the electrons.

  al.} \cite{Weber:1999:EAF}, when they analysed the spin polarization
of transmitted electron waves.

this approximation.  We also depart from the work of Weber \emph{et
  al.} \cite{Weber:1999:EAF} on electron transmission: they regard the
Larmor precession, which is a manifestation of the fact that not all
spin directions are eigen-states of the Hamiltonian in a magnetic
field, as crucial in determining the transmitted polarization.  We
intend to produce a more ``first-principles'' model in the near
future, which will use the matrix representation of the reflection
coefficients, and therefore capture the Larmor precession, and other
spin-flip scattering effects.  However, we don't intend to devise this
model as a replacement for the one presented here, but as a complement
to it.  What we'd like to do is subject both models, along with a
third, completely classical, reflection model, to experimental data,
and use the well-established \cite{MacKay:1992:BMA} methods of
Bayesian statistics, first to infer the parameters of magnetic flux
density, electric potential, and layer thickness, for each model, then
to judge the relative confidence which we have in each model.

I might be inclined to add to this a very different argument
\cite{Hatton:2002:BPR} for not always preferring the most
first-principles model, but this isn't the time or the place for my

\section{Traditional Estimation of the Mott Asymmetries}
d1984 2
a1985 9
Other workers \cite{Gay:1992:MEP, Dunning:1994:MEP} have considered,
in a non-Bayesian framework, the possibility of the two electron
detectors in a Mott polarimeter having different detection
efficiencies, either due to intrinsic properties of the detectors, or
due to a misalignment of the heavy-metal foil that perturbed the
scattering probabilities at the two detectors, and devised the
following estimator of the product $SP$ of Sherman function and beam
polarization, in the presence of such a multiplicative systematic
error:
d1987 1
a1987 2
\label{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}
SP = \frac{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}-\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}{\sqrt{f_{+,1}f_{-,2}}+\sqrt{f_{+,2}f_{-,1}}}\pnc{.}
a1988 11
This estimator relies on the the electron arrival rates $f_{i,j}$, at
detectors $j = 1$ and $j = 2$, being measured for beams which, on
entering the polarimeter, are of the same intensity, and of
polarizations that have equal magnitudes, and opposite signs $i =
\pm$.  These conditions are met, in the experiments currently being
reported, as long as the only effect, on the reflected electron beam,
of reversing the sample magnetization is to reverse the beam
polarization.  In particular, this requires that the spin-orbit
interaction at the sample is negligible, as indeed it is, since the
kinetic energies of the electrons are much less than their rest mass
energy.
d1990 809
a2798 12
In this section, the results will be interpreted using equation
\ref{frequentist-asymmetry-estimator}, as an alternative to the
Bayesian inference process described in section \ref{adaptive-models}.
Note that the estimator could be re-derived, as the expectation value
of $SP$ in a Bayesian model with appropriate assumptions.  This would
have the advantage of allowing these assumptions, which would be made
explicit by the Bayesian approach, to be examined for plausibility,
and changed if necessary (see also appendix \ref{prior}.)
Unfortunately, the model, at least in the simplest case, would be a
model \emph{of} the reflected beam, not of the sample, and therefore
successful estimation of its parameters does not further the aim of
determining characteristics of the sample.
